<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Building the future of computing, on Arm. Together. For everyone. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Our Company </b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm is defining the future
of computing. Semiconductor technology has become one of the world’s most critical resources, as it enables all electronic devices today. At the heart of these devices is the CPU, and Arm is the industry leader of CPUs. We architect, develop,
and license high-performance, <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-cost,</font> and energy-efficient CPU products and related technology, on which many of the world’s leading semiconductor companies and OEMs rely to develop their products. Our
energy-efficient CPUs have enabled advanced computing in greater than 99% of the world’s smartphones, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and more than 250&nbsp;billion chips, cumulatively, powering everything from the tiniest of sensors to
the most powerful supercomputers. Today, Arm CPUs run the vast majority of the world’s software, including the operating systems and applications for smartphones, tablets and personal computers, data centers and networking equipment, and
vehicles, as well as the embedded operating systems in devices such as smartwatches, thermostats, drones and industrial robotics. We estimate that approximately 70% of the world’s population uses
<font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> products, and the scale of Arm’s reach continues to expand, with more than 30&nbsp;billion <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chips reported as shipped in the fiscal year ended
March&nbsp;31, 2023 alone, representing an approximately 70% increase since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Today, any company can
make a modern computer chip through the unique combination of our energy-efficient CPU IP and related technologies and our unmatched ecosystem of technology partners, and do it cost effectively due to our flexible business model. Each CPU product
can be licensed to multiple companies, leading to economies of scale that allow us to charge each licensee only a fraction of what it would cost them to develop internally, while minimizing their risk and <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">time-to-market.</font></font> With the complexity of CPU design increasing exponentially, over the past decade no company has successfully designed a modern CPU from scratch. We have been innovating at the forefront of
compute technology for decades and have established important relationships with the companies driving the future of computing across multiple industries. More than 260 companies reported that they had shipped Arm-based chips in the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2023, including the largest technology companies globally (such as Amazon.com, Inc. and Alphabet Inc.), major semiconductor chip vendors (such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Intel Corporation, NVIDIA Corporation, Qualcomm Inc. and
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.), automotive industry incumbents, leading auto suppliers, IoT innovators, and more. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The exponential rise in
smart devices in both consumer and enterprise markets has increased the demand for chips that provide more computational capability while optimizing energy efficiency. Thirty years ago, the PC was the only computer with which most people would
interact at home, work, or school. Then, mobile phones became computers in our pockets and digital TVs became computers in our living rooms. Now, vehicles are effectively computers on wheels, and servers and networking equipment are the computers
that connect all these devices and services together. Additionally, there are billions of tiny <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-cost</font> devices—from sensors to electric motor controllers—that are now functionally computers, as
well. Each of these computers needs at least one CPU, and in many cases more than one. This trend has driven the dramatic growth of <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chips over the past several years. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our creation of the Arm CPU architecture, the world’s most widely used CPU
architecture, has resulted in the proliferation and evolution of computers as people know them today, advancing a paradigm of increasing compute performance coupled with industry-leading power efficiency. We enabled the mobile phone and smartphone
revolution, and through our focus on energy efficiency and our history of continuous innovation, we have enabled new categories of “smart” consumer electronics. Today, we are redefining what is possible in industries such as cloud
computing, automotive, and IoT. Energy efficiency is not only important for business, but it is also a critical component in achieving sustainability for our planet. This makes Arm CPU technology ideal for current and future computing applications
as the demands for compute performance are growing exponentially while the need for low power remains critical. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Every CPU has an ISA,
which defines the software instructions that can be executed by the CPU, essentially a common language for software developers to use. The ISA sets the foundation for a large library of compatible software which runs on those CPUs. As the Arm CPU is
the most popular and pervasive CPU in history, the Arm ISA is also the most popular and pervasive ISA in history. This means that Arm-based chips have a global community of software developers familiar with how to program the CPU. Chip designers
utilizing the Arm CPU can add desired functionality <font style="white-space:nowrap">(Wi-Fi</font> connectivity, image processing, video processing, <i>etc.</i>) to create an SoC to meet the needs of any end market. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our primary product offerings are leading CPU products that address diverse performance, power, and cost requirements. Complementary products
such as GPUs, System IP, and compute platforms are also available and enable high-performance, efficient, reliable, system-level creation for a wide range of increasingly sophisticated devices and applications. Our development tools and robust
software ecosystem have further solidified our position as the world’s most widely adopted processor architecture and have created a virtuous cycle of adoption, which means that software developers write software for Arm-based devices because
it offers the biggest market for their products, and chip designers choose Arm processors because they have the broadest support of software applications. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This combination of pervasiveness and ease of portability has resulted in our CPU designs having the world’s richest software ecosystem,
built in partnership with the leading operating systems providers (including Google Android, Microsoft Windows and all major Linux distributions), software tools and game engine vendors (such as Electronic Arts Inc., Unity Software Inc. and Epic
Games, Inc.), and application developers. We also support a flourishing ecosystem of third-party tool vendors for embedded software and a vibrant IoT ecosystem. Open-source software plays a vital role in the success of
<font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chips, and we are committed to contributing to open-source software and tools to ensure our offerings are optimized for the latest technologies. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the world moves increasingly towards AI- and ML-enabled computing, Arm will be central to this transition. Arm CPUs already run AI and ML
workloads in billions of devices, including smartphones, cameras, digital TVs, cars and cloud data centers. The CPU is vital in all AI systems, whether it is handling the AI workload entirely or in combination with a
<font style="white-space:nowrap">co-processor,</font> such as a GPU or an NPU. In the emerging area of large language models, generative AI and autonomous driving, there will be a heightened emphasis on the low power acceleration of these
algorithms. In our latest ISA, CPUs, and GPUs, we have added new functionality and instructions to accelerate future AI and ML algorithms. We are working with leading companies such as Alphabet, Cruise LLC, Mercedes-Benz, Meta and NVIDIA to deploy
Arm technology to run AI workloads. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm had 5,963 full-time employees across North America, Europe and Asia as of March&nbsp;31, 2023. We
are an engineering-first company, with approximately 80% of our global employees, as of March&nbsp;31, 2023, focused on research, design, and technical innovation, and we have global operations and research and development (“R&amp;D”)
centers in the U.K., Europe, North America, India, and Asia-Pacific. Our headquarters are located in Cambridge, U.K. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2023, our total revenue was relatively flat at $2,679 million, as compared to $2,703 million in the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2022. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, as a

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Established in 1990, Arm began as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple Computer, and VLSI Technology. We were publicly listed on the
London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market from 1998 until 2016, when we were taken private by SoftBank Group, our controlling shareholder. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The original joint venture set out to develop a processor that was high performance, power efficient, easy to program, and readily
scalable—a goal that continues to define Arm today. Our CPUs initially gained significant traction in mobile phones in the <font style="white-space:nowrap">mid-1990s</font> because our energy-efficient processors provided an appropriate level
of performance while consuming little power, which was critical for these smaller form factor devices. Over time, mobile phones, and the chips they used, became more advanced and ultimately evolved into the smartphones that are prevalent today. The
Arm CPU proved to be critical in enabling the smartphone revolution. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The mobile phone was one of the first consumer electronic devices to
evolve into an intelligent, connected, digital device that needed a smart processor to run a growing library of software. With the help of Arm technology, many more devices such as televisions, watches, washing machines, cameras, factory equipment,
and others are undergoing the same revolution. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Strategic Evolution </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since becoming a private company in 2016, we have made significant investments to further develop and market our products to build on our
success in powering the world’s smartphones and other consumer electronic devices. We have focused in recent years on making Arm the ubiquitous provider of compute technology in all market segments by expanding into new markets, including cloud
computing, networking, automotive, and IoT, most of which have strong secular tailwinds. Our investments have resulted in a diversified business with more durable growth. </p>

indispensable to everyday life. In today’s technology-driven world, semiconductors are the enablers of the devices and infrastructure that facilitate virtually everything people do, such as making a phone call, sending an email, storing files
in the cloud, streaming videos, or traveling by car, train, or plane. Almost all of the products and services people use every day rely on semiconductors. Manufacturing, logistics, city infrastructure, and building management also increasingly build
their processes and services around semiconductor-enabled devices. As consumers and enterprises continue to demand more from their devices, the pervasiveness of high-performance and energy-efficient semiconductors will continue to expand. We believe
there are several key trends driving the growth and evolution of the semiconductor industry. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Proliferation of Smart, Connected Devices Supporting

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The resources required to develop leading-edge products are significant and continue to increase exponentially as manufacturing process nodes
shrink. According to the International Business Strategy, Inc. (“IBS”), IC design costs were approximately $249&nbsp;million for a 7nm chip and approximately $725&nbsp;million for a 2nm chip, representing approximately a <font style="white-space:nowrap">three-times</font> increase in design cost as compared to a 7nm chip. Design partners play an increasingly valuable role in the chip design process by providing specialized capabilities and expertise that enable
semiconductor suppliers to focus on their core product differentiation, while keeping pace with market innovation. Design partners facilitate innovation and enhance customers’ competitive positioning by reducing the complexity, risk, and cost
of a significant part of the development cycle. For example, to design a 2nm chip, IBS estimates that the software development, verification, and IP qualification is 71% of the overall cost. In addition, design partners, like Arm, that can
demonstrate a deep understanding of their customers’ workloads are better positioned to integrate themselves into their customers’ workflows, further expanding their value proposition over time. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Growth of <font style="white-space:nowrap">In-House</font> Development and Custom Silicon Chips </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many OEMs today utilize <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">“off-the-shelf,”</font></font> or
“merchant,” semiconductors when building their product offerings. However, this approach can introduce compromises. For example, an OEM may use a chip that includes features that are irrelevant for its use case, at the expense of
performance and cost efficiency. Similarly, an OEM may need a chip that incorporates features not otherwise available from a merchant supplier. As a result, leading OEMs are increasingly looking to build custom chips in-house that deliver greater
performance and greater efficiency at an equal or better price for a particular use case. The success of <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> products such as Amazon’s Graviton, deployed across Amazon data centers globally, have
demonstrated the opportunity to create a sustainable competitive advantage through this approach. For example, Amazon claims that Graviton delivers up to 40% better price performance over comparable x86-based systems. This trend of increasing use of
in-house developed solutions has significantly expanded the opportunity for Arm. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Our Solution </b></p>

issued ordinary shares of Arm Limited. In connection with the corporate reorganization, the shareholders of Arm Limited exchanged each of the ordinary shares held by them in Arm Limited for newly issued ordinary shares of Arm Holdings Limited of the
same class and in the same proportions as their previous shareholdings in Arm Limited. As a result, Arm Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arm Holdings Limited. On &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
2023, Arm Holdings Limited <font style="white-space:nowrap">re-registered</font> as a public limited company under the laws of England and Wales and changed its name from Arm Holdings Limited to Arm Holdings plc. The consolidated financial
statements included in this prospectus do not show the effect of the corporate reorganization. See “Corporate Reorganization” for more information. </p>

requirements related to the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations applicable to a security registered under the Exchange Act. In addition, our executive officers and directors are exempt from the reporting and “short-swing”
profit recovery provisions of Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act and related rules with respect to their purchases and sales of our securities. Moreover, we are not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as
frequently or as promptly as U.S. public companies. Accordingly, there may be less publicly available information concerning us than there is for U.S. public companies. </p>

four months after the end of each fiscal year, while U.S. domestic issuers that are accelerated filers are required to file their annual report on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">10-K</font> within 75 days after the end of each fiscal year.
Foreign private issuers are also exempt from Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure), which is aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information. </p>

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Investing in our ADSs involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other
information in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” before deciding whether to invest in
our ADSs. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In such an event, the market price of our ADSs could decline and you may lose
all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may materially impair our business operations. </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry </b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Demand
for our products and services primarily depends on trends in the semiconductor and electronics industries and the demand for the products of our customers and our customers’ customers. </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Demand for our products and services is largely dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries, which are volatile, intensely
competitive and generally characterized by declining ASPs over the life of a generation of chips. The effect of these price decreases is compounded by the fact that our royalty rates generally decrease as the volume of sales increases, subject to an
agreed minimum royalty per chip. Additionally, demand for our products and services could decrease if growth in the semiconductor or electronics industries slows or declines. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The revenue we generate from licensing activities is also largely dependent on the rate at which systems companies develop and adopt new
product generations, which, in turn, is affected by the level of demand for their ICs and other products. Decreasing demand from systems companies for chips based on our products would directly and adversely affect the amount of royalties we
receive. As a result of our dependence on demand from systems companies, we are subject to several risks affecting these systems companies, any one of which may influence the success or failure of a particular systems company. These risks include,
among others: </p> <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</p>

automotive, embedded and IoT, enterprise electronics, and mobile and consumer electronics markets. There are competing microprocessor architectures in the market and there is no certainty that
the market will continue to accept our products to the same or greater extent than it does today. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Demand from large, global systems
companies, including OEMs, drive much of the development of silicon chips and computer systems. Accordingly, acceptance of our products by these companies as well as semiconductor and other companies for use in a variety of end-market applications
is critical for our continued success. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The semiconductor and electronics industries have also become increasingly complex and subject to
increasing design and manufacturing costs. Many of our customers utilize third-party vendors for EDA tools and also outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. We work closely with major EDA vendors and foundries to ensure
that our products are compatible with their design tools and manufacturing processes. However, if we fail to optimize our products for use with major EDA vendors’ tools and foundries’ manufacturing processes, or if our access to such tools
and processes is hampered, then our products may become less desirable to our customers. Similarly, for customers that do not outsource design and manufacturing processes, if our products are unsuitable for the customers’ internal processes,
then our products may not be acceptable to those customers. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, there are risks inherent in the manufacturing of
next-generation process technologies, including production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects and errata. If foundries are unable to successfully or efficiently manufacture future generations of chips
based on our products, demand for our products could be materially adversely affected along with our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market for our products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in design and manufacturing technologies, end-user
requirements, industry standards, and frequent new product introductions and improvements. We anticipate continued challenges from current and new competitors, including established technologies such as the x86 architecture, as well as by free,
open-source technologies, including the <font style="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V</font> architecture. Many of our customers are also major supporters of the <font style="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V</font> architecture and related technologies. If <font style="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V-related</font> technology continues to be developed and market support for <font style="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V</font> increases, our customers may choose to utilize this free, open-source architecture instead of
our products. Additionally, many of our direct and indirect competitors, including some of our semiconductor customers, are major corporations with substantially greater technical, financial and marketing resources and name recognition than we have.
Some of these competitors have a much larger application software base and a much larger installed customer base than we do, and there can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise, and marketing, distribution
and support capabilities to compete successfully with them in the future. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In markets where we are established already and new markets we
have entered or intend to enter, our primary competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, support or other resources and capabilities, greater brand recognition, lower labor and development costs, different regulatory
restrictions or a larger customer base than we do. In these markets, we may have to invest substantial resources into developing an ecosystem of software and tools to create a competitive ecosystem that allows us to compete with alternative
architectures such as x86 and <font style="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V,</font> which have business models that are different from ours and may be more attractive to some of our customers. Our competitors may devote greater resources to the
development, promotion and sale of products and services, they may offer lower pricing and different customer engagement models, and their performance, features and product quality may be more desirable than those of our company. Our current and
potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources or strengthen their positions within these markets, or may be subject to more favorable regulatory
regimes. For example, in August 2023, a group of our customers and </p>

other competitors announced a joint venture aimed at accelerating the adoption of RISC-V. Although the development of alternative architectures and technology is a time-intensive process, if our
competitors establish cooperative relationships or consolidate with each other or third parties, such as the recently announced joint venture focused on RISC-V, they may have additional resources that would allow them to more quickly develop
architectures and other technology that directly compete with our products. Such cooperative relationships or consolidations may also allow competitors to anticipate or respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing
opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in revenue and profitability. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some semiconductor companies have developed their own proprietary architecture for specific markets or applications. These companies may
utilize their proprietary architecture to penetrate markets where we are currently the architecture of choice, or where our products may be utilized, making it more difficult for us to penetrate such markets in the future. Some semiconductor
companies have proprietary architectures in applications, including, but not limited to, automotive, data center equipment, networking equipment, electronic storage, microcontrollers, smart sensors, servers and wireless communications. These
companies may be significantly entrenched in their markets. If these companies are successful in displacing our products, or if we are unable to penetrate or grow our market share in these areas, licensing opportunities and potential royalties could
be harmed, negatively affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Our development systems tools business also faces significant competition from both the open-source community and third-party tools and software
suppliers. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While our customers likely would incur significant costs in switching to competitors’ architecture, our competitors
(including new market entrants) may offer greater incentives to customers through rebates, marketing funds, similar programs and other commercial arrangements to induce them to use their architecture in lieu of our products. Additionally, our
competitors with multiple products or services may bundle their architecture, products and services to offer a broader product portfolio (which may include products or services we do not offer), which may make it difficult for us to gain or maintain
market share. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Physical IP business also faces significant competition from third parties, including the internal design groups of IC
manufacturers that have expanded their internal design capabilities and portfolio of Physical IP components. Physical IP components developed internally by our customers may be designed specifically to utilize the unique qualities of their own
manufacturing processes, and may benefit from capacity, informational, cost and technical advantages relative to our Physical IP components, and we may be unable to compete effectively with such internal design groups. </p>

selling additional products to our existing customers and increasing the price we charge to existing customers represent our principal opportunities to increase revenue (particularly licensing revenue). We generate a significant portion of our

years), our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected, and we would become more dependent on new growth areas to increase revenue and improve our financial condition. We are currently focused on
growing our business in key areas such as infrastructure, automotive, IoT, AI and 5G. Numerous factors, however, may impede our ability to grow our business in these key areas, add new customers and sell additional products to our existing

believe they can do so more effectively than us or if supply and capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry further incentivize vertical integration in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains. Some of these
customers may have greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, management, marketing, service, support, technical, distribution and other resources than we do. If our customers, and particularly one or more key customers from whom
we generate a significant portion of our total revenues, elect to develop their own processors based on our ISA, the market for our developed processor portfolio would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of

a limited number of key customers. In particular, our top five customers (including Arm China) collectively accounted for approximately 57% and 56% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and our
largest customer individually, Arm China, accounted for approximately 24% and 18% of our total revenue, respectively, during those fiscal years. As a result of this customer concentration, we are particularly susceptible to adverse developments
affecting our key customers and their respective businesses, including industry downturns, decreased demand for their products, increased competition, changes in trade protection and other government policies, financial hardship and changes in their
business model, purchasing behavior and strategic priorities, among other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, developments in our key customers’ respective businesses that adversely affect their ability to satisfy
their payment obligations to us or result in their determination not to continue or expand their use of our products would have a material adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations to a greater extent than if our customer base were
more diversified. Our customer concentration also has afforded certain customers significant bargaining power, which has, in some cases, resulted in pricing or other contractual terms that are less favorable to us. For example, subject to certain
limitations, certain of our contracts with key customers contain provisions allowing such customers to obtain licenses to our latest products as soon as they are made available to any other customer. If we were to lose one or more of our key
customers or if our business with one or more key customers were to decrease significantly, whether as a result of external impacts on the business of those customers, or, for example, as a result of disputes with such customers with respect to
pricing models, there are no assurances that we would be successful in identifying and contracting with one or more customers to replace any lost revenue, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial

bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on our products, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For example, in the past, some of our larger customers who
have negotiated lower pricing models have acquired customers with higher pricing models. In some cases, we have been, and in the future may be, required to renegotiate the pricing model with the acquired company or to honor the lower pricing model
applicable for the acquiring customer while providing the same products prior to the acquisition by the larger company. </p>

as a result of changes in consumer behavior. If these end markets do not expand, we may be unable to continue to grow our revenues significantly from these markets, if at all. Additionally, circumstances outside of our control, such as the invention
of new technologies, could adversely affect the smartphone and consumer electronics markets as a whole, which would have a material adverse impact on our revenue, profitability, and ability to attract new customers. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our products are extensible and have been licensed and used in various other target end markets. While these new target markets represent a
meaningful opportunity for us, they may not grow or develop as quickly as we expect them to. Furthermore, it could take years to reach a market share similar to our position in smartphones and consumer electronics. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other microprocessor architectures such as x86 and <font style="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V</font> may already exist across all of these
markets, or may be developed for applications within these markets. For applications in markets such as computing, data centers, networking and servers, competing microprocessor architectures, such as x86, already have a large, <font style="white-space:nowrap">well-established</font> customer base and are supported by a broad base of related software and development tools. These markets represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce
new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These new markets may not grow as projected or at all,
and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. Due to the interdependence of various components in the products in which our architecture and our competitors’ architectures are used, customers are unlikely to change to another
product, once adopted, until the next generation of a technology. As a result, even if our products are superior to alternative offerings, it may be difficult for our products to displace alternative technologies as a result of high switching costs
to change to our products, including the need for potential customers to make significant investments in additional training and development tools and to convert software for existing devices. Additionally, to the extent our competitors have done
business with prospective customers for a long period of time and have established relationships, our competitors may have information regarding future trends and requirements of such prospective customers that may not be available to us. If any of
these markets do not develop as we currently anticipate or we fail to establish ourselves in these new markets, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our competitive position and business prospects. </p>

global semiconductor market, as certain countries want more <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">end-to-end</font></font> control over architecture, leading to increased architectural fragmentation and a reduced role for
a global architecture. Countries may take political decisions to enforce the use of an alternative architecture, or locally generated implementations for certain use cases, to make their country more resilient in the case of trade barriers or for
national security reasons. For us, this could lead to increased costs to support region specific products, reduced revenue as a result of lost investment in territories that no longer use our products and potential market loss and loss of future
licensing opportunities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </p>

characterized by rapidly changing technology and <font style="white-space:nowrap">end-user</font> needs. For example, improvements are rapidly being made in AI, cloud computing, data centers, image sensors, ML and the metaverse, among other
technologies. Furthermore, the once-rapid improvements in semiconductor transistor density, with consequent reductions in cost and power consumption, are decelerating, and further innovation will become incrementally more difficult and expensive to
achieve. As a result of these rapid technological changes and others currently unknown, the future market for our products is difficult to predict. These risks are further exacerbated by the fact that our products often use a common architecture for
multiple end markets and our new architecture products often are based on legacy products. Therefore, if our architecture were rendered uncompetitive, obsolete, or otherwise unmarketable it may impact multiple products and may cause us to expend
significant resources and incur significant expenses to develop a new architecture. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our business, reputation and relationships with our

efforts in the amounts we anticipate, on the expected timeline or at all. For instance, in the past we have experienced delays in the development of certain of our products, which then delayed product deployment and the associated revenues. </p>

market requirements or market demand for our products in our target markets, our business will suffer. A market shift towards an industry standard that we do not currently support and for which we are not currently developing new products could
significantly decrease the demand for our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial financial and other resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing, and management efforts, to developing and marketing our products
in anticipation of incorporation into new <font style="white-space:nowrap">end-user</font> applications. Additionally, our competitors may have a competitive advantage if their assessments relating to market adoption of new technologies prove to be
more accurate than our assessments. Our failure to anticipate or timely develop new or enhanced products in response to changing market demand could result in the loss of customers and decreased revenue and have a material and adverse effect on our
business, cash flows, results of operations and prospects. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we develop and introduce new products, we face the risk that customers may
not value or be willing to bear the cost of incorporating these newer products into their chips, including increases in royalty rates for such new products (as compared to existing products), particularly if they believe their customers are
satisfied with the current products or unwilling to pay for improved products. Regardless of the improved features or superior performance of the newer products we develop, customers may be unwilling to adopt our new products for a variety of
reasons, including design or pricing constraints. Moreover, the complexity and expense associated with our products generally requires a lengthy customer education, evaluation and approval process. Further, economic conditions, including economic
downturns and rising rates of inflation, may adversely impact our ability to license products by making it difficult for our customers to plan future business activities, which could cause customers to limit spending or delay decision-making. </p>

For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, although our total revenues derived from the PRC
increased as compared to the prior fiscal year, the growth in our royalty revenues derived from the PRC slowed for the same period primarily as a result of economic issues in the PRC and factors related to export control and national security
matters. Furthermore, in light of these issues, we expect to continue to see declining royalty revenues, and we could see a decline in licensing revenues, derived from the PRC. A prolonged downturn in the PRC semiconductor industry or the PRC

Although our inability to sell such Neoverse processor into the PRC has not had a material impact on our business to date, future restrictions on sales of our products into the PRC could have a material adverse impact on our business. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August 9, 2023, President Biden issued an executive order addressing investments by U.S. persons in companies located in the PRC that
engage with certain categories of sensitive technology and products, including semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies and artificial intelligence. The executive order requires regulations that would implement limits on
such investments and was accompanied by an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that outlines proposed regulations; however, the proposed regulations do not have immediate effect, are subject to public comment and a further rulemaking process and
will not become effective until the rulemaking process is complete at some time in the future. While we believe it is possible that such regulations may impact our PRC customers, our suppliers, Arm China, or our business with respect to China, given
the uncertainties with respect to the timing and ultimate requirements of these regulations, we are unable to assess the extent of any such impact. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, government policies in the PRC that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may

We expect that our licensing relationship
with Arm China will continue to account for substantially all of our total revenues from the PRC and represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. It would be difficult for us to replace any lost <font style="white-space:nowrap">PRC-sourced</font> revenue in the event that our commercial relationship with Arm China were to terminate or deteriorate. Accordingly, we expect that Arm China will continue to provide our primary access to the PRC market
for the foreseeable future. If we fail to maintain our commercial relationship with Arm China, our access to the PRC market could be materially diminished and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects for growth could be
materially and adversely affected. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Neither we nor SoftBank Group control the operations of Arm China, which operates independently of us.

conduit to the important PRC market, Arm China operates independently of us. On March&nbsp;28, 2022, we transferred our entire equity interest in Arm China to a subsidiary of SoftBank Group. As of the date of this prospectus, approximately 48% of
the equity interest in Arm China is owned by Acetone Limited, which is controlled by SoftBank Group and in which we own a 10% non-voting interest, approximately 35% is indirectly owned by HOPU Investment Management Company, and approximately 17% is
directly and indirectly owned by other Chinese parties. Our 10% non-voting interest in Acetone Limited represents an approximate 4.8% indirect ownership interest in Arm China. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fact that Arm China operates independently of us exposes us to significant risks. Arm
China’s value to us as a customer is dependent on Arm China’s business results, which are, in turn, subject to substantial risks that are outside of our control. For example, Arm China may not commit the necessary resources to market and
sell our products to PRC end-users of our semiconductor IP products. Arm China also may fail to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements applicable to its business, which could limit its ability to market or sell our products in the PRC. In
addition, Arm China may fail to attract, train, retain and motivate highly skilled managerial and technical personnel necessary for its business. Arm China may also have difficulties accessing funding or enforcing contractual relationships. The
realization of these or other risks related to Arm China’s business may have a material adverse effect on Arm China’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and, by extension, our own. Since Arm China operates
independently of us and we do not control Arm China, our ability to take measures to address the various risks facing Arm China is limited. If any of such risks related to Arm China’s business are realized, our revenue could materially decline
and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the IPLA with Arm China, Arm China’s payments due to us
are determined based on the financial information that Arm China provides to us. Accordingly, similar to our other royalty customers, we are dependent on Arm China providing us with reliable and timely information. We perform various procedures to
assess the reasonableness of Arm China’s data, and the IPLA includes rights for us to audit Arm China’s activities to ensure compliance with the IPLA. In the past, we have had issues obtaining timely and accurate information from Arm
China. We believe the underlying problems causing our past inability to obtain such information have been resolved, but we can provide no assurances that our access to Arm China’s records will not be inhibited again in the future. If Arm China
does not provide us with timely and accurate information, our revenue could materially decline and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We are also dependent on Arm China paying us the amounts that it owes us in a timely
manner and in full. In the past, we have received late payments from Arm China and have had to expend company resources to obtain payments from Arm China. Although these historical issues did not have a material impact on our operations, any future
failure to pay us the amounts we are owed under the IPLA could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, Arm China has possession of or access to certain material IP and customer data pursuant to the IPLA and other commercial
arrangements with us. Although Arm China is contractually obligated to protect this IP and data, we are limited in our ability to monitor or influence the manner in which Arm China protects our IP and data from theft, loss or misuse. Arm China
operates its own separate information technology infrastructure. Aside from customary audit rights and protections under the IPLA, we are therefore unable to independently assure the adequacy of protections that Arm China implements with respect to
its possession and/or access to our IP and data. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, under the IPLA with Arm China, we are contractually obligated to indemnify
both Arm China and its PRC customers that sublicense our IP in the event that either Arm China or such customers incur damages or costs in lawsuits, administrative proceedings or similar actions based upon a claim that our IP infringes the IP of a
third party. The liability that we incur to Arm China or its PRC customers under such provisions could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, since April 2022, Allen Wu, the former chief executive officer of Arm China, and certain entities under his effective control,
have initiated several lawsuits in the courts of the PRC seeking to challenge certain aspects of Arm China’s corporate governance and the actions of Arm China’s board of directors. To date, all cases that have been resolved at the trial
court level have been resolved favorably to Arm China but are subject to appeal. In the event that certain of these cases were to be decided adversely to Arm China, it could result in further changes to Arm China’s corporate governance and
management structure, which could reduce SoftBank Group’s ability to conduct effective oversight of Arm China and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </p>

semiconductor companies and OEMs may increasingly develop their own technology and use such technology in their devices, or use our competitors’ technology in their devices. Specifically, the PRC government’s 14th Five-Year Plan and
related initiatives have identified the development of globally competitive PRC companies in “core technologies” such as semiconductors as a key policy focus. As part of a government-wide effort to encourage investment and development of
domestic semiconductor capabilities, the PRC government could encourage financing opportunities to our competitors in the PRC on favorable terms, or influence major PRC customers to favor adoption of IP of our competitors in the PRC over our own IP.
</p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to Arm China, although the terms of the IPLA with Arm China prohibit Arm China from developing microprocessor cores and only
allow Arm China to develop derivative products using Arm IP with our consent, Arm China may independently develop competitive products other than microprocessor cores and could divert customer interest from our products to increase its market share
to our detriment. The realization of any such risks could materially harm our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. </p>

due to, among other things, high inflation, deteriorating financial conditions, and rising geopolitical tensions. We are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic conditions. In particular, due to economic uncertainties in
many of our key markets, our customers and their customers may delay, suspend or reduce technology purchases and investments and/or delay their payments to us. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Economic conditions could continue to deteriorate in the future, and, in particular, the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail
to grow, including as a result of the effects of, among other things, rising inflation and interest rates, a sustained global semiconductor shortage, supply chain disruptions, the <font style="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</font> pandemic and any
disruption of international trade relationships such as tariffs, export licenses or other government trade restrictions. In addition, adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that our products help create, such as smartphones,
automobiles and servers. Longer-term reduced demand for these or other devices could result in reduced demand for our products and significant decreases in our licensing fees and royalties over time. In addition, if our customers or distributors
build elevated inventory levels, we could experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand for our products. If any of these events or disruptions were to occur, the demand for our products could be materially adversely affected along

confidence and wages, leading to a decrease in the gross domestic product of the U.K. Brexit could also adversely affect the political, regulatory, economic or market conditions in the U.K., the European Union and worldwide, and could contribute to
instability in political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We regularly maintain cash balances at third-party

March&nbsp;12, 2023 and May&nbsp;1, 2023, respectively. We do not have any direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, New York Signature Bank or First Republic Bank. However, if other banks and financial institutions, including financial institutions
at which we maintain deposits, enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets or otherwise, our ability and our customers’ ability to access cash, cash

seek, to renegotiate <font style="white-space:nowrap">pre-existing</font> contractual commitments. Payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial

an annual increase in license fees. However, these annual increases may fall below the then-current rate of inflation, which could make maintaining these licenses less profitable than we had anticipated when we originally signed the license. To the

materially and adversely affect our profitability. In certain geographic regions, there is also intense competition for sales and marketing personnel, which may adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets. Particularly, changes to the

limit the terms of any such licenses, we may be required to license our patents or other IP to others in the future, which could limit the effectiveness of our patents against competitors. In these situations, the royalty rates we charge could be
limited for these products, and we may be unable to limit to whom we license such products or to restrict many terms of the license. As a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, our costs of enforcing our licenses or
protecting our patents may increase, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired. We may in the future be subject to claims that our licensing of industry standard technologies may not conform to the requirements of the standards-setting

open-source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of license we customarily use
to protect our IP. In the event that the copyright holder of any open-source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code

National Security and Investment Act 2021 or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) or other laws or regulations may limit our ability to acquire, invest in or integrate targets, or may force us to divest an acquired business or

as of March&nbsp;31, 2023 (25.1% and 3.1%, respectively, as of March&nbsp;31, 2022). Within other intangible assets, our principal assets are our patents and licenses (6.5% of total other intangible assets as of March&nbsp;31, 2023) and software or
software assets under construction (90.6% of total other intangible assets as of March&nbsp;31, 2023). Any further acquisitions may result in our recognition of additional goodwill or other intangible assets. We evaluate on a regular basis whether
all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired. Under current accounting rules, any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to record an impairment charge, which would negatively affect our results
of operations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognized impairments for the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2022 in relation to specific historically acquired or

and amortize the qualifying costs of internally developed software for its operating platforms and related back-office systems over the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets (generally between three and five years). If projects fail to
deliver anticipated results in line with our estimates and assumptions, then we may be required to write-down the intangible asset costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our
securities. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An impairment or write-down of a significant portion of goodwill, other intangible assets or capitalized development costs

and future financing activities as well as certain financial and operational covenants. Such restrictions and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that otherwise might be deemed to be in the best interest of us and holders of our ADSs. Debt
service obligations may require us in the future to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments of principal and interest on our interest-bearing debt, which could limit our ability to obtain additional financing,
make capital expenditures and acquisitions and carry out other general corporate activities in the future. Any such obligations may also limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we

patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not result in the issuance of patents with the scope of protection we seek, including in jurisdictions of strategic importance
and, if issued, may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage. The scope of our patent protections may be adversely affected by changes in legal precedent and patent office interpretation of these precedents. Further, patents
directed to particular subject matter associated with our business (e.g., CPU architecture) may be difficult to obtain and enforce in many jurisdictions and there may also be limits on recovery for damages in those jurisdictions. Any of our existing
patents, and any future patents, may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Further, we may be unsuccessful in executing adequate invention assignment agreements with all employees, contractors or other third parties involved in the
development of our IP portfolio. In certain jurisdictions, rights to IP developed by our employees or contractors or other third parties may not automatically vest in us, and our employees or contractors or other third parties may claim ownership in
IP that we believe is owned by us. We may also be required to spend significant resources to establish, monitor and protect our IP rights, particularly as we expand our operations globally. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our exposure to different legal jurisdictions also may impact our ability to exercise our contractual and other rights around IP in such
jurisdictions, in particular in countries whose laws regarding the protection of IP are less rigorous or more difficult to enforce than in the U.K., the U.S. and the European Union. In jurisdictions where effective IP protection is unavailable or
limited, our IP rights may be vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure, infringement, misappropriation or other violation by employees, third-party partners, suppliers, customers and other entities or individuals, even though our customers and partners
are contractually restricted from using our IP outside of the agreed-upon licensing arrangements. Policing unauthorized use of our IP is difficult and expensive, and we may not be able, or may lack the resources, to prevent infringement,
misappropriation or other violation of our IP rights, including increased difficulty as a foreign entity in certain international locations, particularly outside the U.K., the U.S. and the European Union. In addition, our ability to monitor and
control theft, misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the U.K., the U.S. and the European Union, as the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our proprietary and
confidential information as do the laws of the U.K., the U.S. and the European Union. Moreover, because we deliver our products to our customers in a source form, we have limited ability to trace the source of misappropriation of our IP and there
are limited technological barriers (e.g., remote authorization requirements) we can put in place to protect our products from use by unauthorized parties. Additionally, theft of our IP or proprietary business information (including our trade
secrets) could require substantial expenditures and resources to remedy. If we, our employees or our third-party partners, consultants, contractors, vendors or service providers were to suffer an attack or breach, for example, that results in the
unauthorized access to, or use, theft, disclosure, misappropriation or sale of, our IP by any unauthorized third parties, we may have to notify consumers, partners or governmental authorities, and may be subject to investigations, civil penalties,
administrative and enforcement actions and litigation, any of which could be costly and distracting or otherwise harm our business and reputation. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may be unable to successfully obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our IP rights (including defending against counterfeit, <font style="white-space:nowrap">knock-off,</font> grey-market, infringing or otherwise unauthorized goods). Specifically, third parties may distribute, license and sell counterfeit or grey-market versions of our products, which may be inferior or pose
safety risks and could confuse consumers or customers, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future or otherwise damage our reputation. The presence of counterfeit versions of our products and technology in the market
could also dilute the value of our brands, force us and our customers to compete with heavily discounted products and technology, cause us to be in breach of contract (including license agreements), impact our compliance with distribution and
competition laws in jurisdictions including the U.K., the U.S., the European Union and the PRC, or otherwise have a negative impact on our reputation and business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Further, we may not be able
to detect all violations of our IP rights and, even if we do become aware of any such violations, we may not be able to adequately enforce our IP rights in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions. If we are unable to successfully navigate the

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our patents and other IP rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity
and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, misappropriation or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us, could be costly and would divert the efforts
and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our IP
rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our IP rights. In addition, counterparties in litigation may have greater resources that they can dedicate to litigation-related matters
than we can. Moreover, litigation against current or former customers and partners may adversely impact existing relationships. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our IP
rights. See also “—We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement, misappropriation or other violation of their IP rights or proprietary rights and our defense against these claims can be costly.” </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In any potential dispute involving our patents or other IP, our licensees or the customers of our licensees could also become the target of
litigation and we may be bound to indemnify such parties under the terms of our license agreements. Although our indemnification obligations are generally subject to a maximum amount, such obligations could nevertheless result in substantial
expenses to us. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” In addition to the time and expense required for us to indemnify our licensees or the customers of our licensees, such parties’ development, marketing and sales of chips and end
products utilizing our products could be severely disrupted or discontinued as a result of litigation, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, the semiconductor industry is generally subject to high turnover of employees, so the risk of trade secret misappropriation may be
amplified. If any of our trade secrets are subject to unauthorized disclosure or are otherwise misappropriated by third parties, our competitive position may be materially and adversely affected. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any adverse determinations in litigation could result in the loss of our IP rights or proprietary rights, subject us to significant
liabilities, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from licensing our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Our failure to
obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our IP rights could have a material adverse effect on our brand or our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, because our products are often based on a common
architecture and our new products are often based on legacy products, adverse events related to our IP may have a more significant impact on us than if our products were less related. </p>

party files a claim in court or another venue asserting that our products infringe such third party’s IP rights. Although we do not agree to indemnify our customers’ end customers, such end customers may be subject to infringement claims
and may initiate claims against us as a result. Claims alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third-party IP rights can result in costly and time-consuming litigation (regardless of their validity or merit), require us to
enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting the sale of our products, result in the invalidation of a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo

our business, which may include claims with respect to commercial, product liability, IP, cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, antitrust, breach of contract, labor and employment, whistleblower, mergers and acquisitions and other matters. We are
involved in pending litigation, including, but not limited to, a lawsuit with Qualcomm Inc. and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (together “Qualcomm”) and Nuvia, Inc. (“Nuvia”). In addition, our products are involved in pending
litigation to which we are not a party. We cannot provide you any assurances regarding how any such litigation will be resolved, what benefits we will obtain or what losses we might incur.</p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August&nbsp;31, 2022, we sued Qualcomm and Nuvia in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, on the basis that Qualcomm and
Nuvia: (i)&nbsp;breached the termination provisions of Nuvia’s Architecture License Agreement (the “Nuvia ALA”) with us by failing to destroy technology Nuvia developed under the Nuvia ALA, which we terminated in March 2022 based on
Nuvia’s failure to obtain our consent to the assignment of the Nuvia ALA to Qualcomm; and (ii)&nbsp;will infringe our trademarks when Qualcomm uses them in connection with the Nuvia technology subject to destruction under the Nuvia ALA. Our
complaint seeks, among other things, specific performance of the Nuvia ALA termination provisions to require Qualcomm and Nuvia to stop using and to destroy the relevant Nuvia technology and to stop their improper use of our trademarks with their
related products. We also seek declaratory judgment, injunctive relief and damages relating to Qualcomm’s and Nuvia’s breach of contract and infringement of our trademarks in connection with the relevant Nuvia technology. Qualcomm has
responded and brought a counterclaim against us seeking a declaratory judgment that after Qualcomm’s acquisition of Nuvia, Qualcomm’s proposed products are fully licensed from us under its separate license agreements with us and that it
has complied with its contractual obligations to us and Nuvia did not breach the Nuvia ALA. We and Qualcomm can amend our respective claims to seek additional or different relief as the proceedings progress. We can provide no assurances regarding
the outcome of the litigation or how the litigation will affect our relationship with Qualcomm, which is currently a major customer of ours and accounted for 11% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. This case is currently
in the discovery phase, with trial set for September 2024, and will likely require significant legal expenditures going forward. It may also require substantial time and attention from our executives or employees, which could distract them from
operating our business. In addition, our involvement in such litigation could cause us to incur significant reputational damage in the industry, in our relationship with Qualcomm or in our relationship with other

resources, cause us to incur significant expenses and lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims. Allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of whether there
is merit to such claims. Furthermore, because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected by an
unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations. </p>

organizations and hacking by groups and individuals. These sources can also implement social engineering techniques to induce our third-party partners, users, employees or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other
actions to gain access to our or our third-party partners’ data or our users’ data. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems or networks are constantly evolving and may not be recognized until launched
against a target. Therefore, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we may face delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, such cyberattacks,
security breaches and other similar incidents. Geopolitical instability, such as the war between Russia and Ukraine, may increase the likelihood that we or our third-party partners and customers could experience direct or collateral consequences
from cyber conflicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, and as our products are used in
more heavily regulated industries where there may be a greater concentration of sensitive and protected data, such as healthcare, government, life sciences and financial services, we and our third-party partners may become more of a target for these

third-party partners, customers or suppliers, or cause a significant disruptive effect on our services, which could result in us, our third-party partners or our customers suffering significant financial or reputational damage and potential
third-party legal action. If our security measures are, or are believed to be, inadequate or breached as a result of third-party action, employee negligence, error or malfeasance, fraud, product defects, accidental technological failure, social
engineering techniques, improper user configuration or otherwise, and this results in, or is believed to result in, actual disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data or our third-party partners’ and customers’
data, or otherwise causes a significant disruptive effect on our services, we could incur significant liability to various parties, including our third-party partners and customers, and to individuals or organizations whose information is being
stored by us, our third-party partners or our customers. Further, such information and data being stored in foreign jurisdictions, could lead to us being required to disclose or provide access to data or IP to a foreign government pursuant to
national security or other laws of such foreign jurisdiction. Any perceived or actual violation of security, data protection and/or reporting obligations under relevant privacy and data protection laws, regulations, rules, standards and other
obligations could also result in regulatory inquiries, investigations and enforcement actions, fines and/or legal action. We incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent cyberattacks, security breaches and other similar incidents, and

business interruption, employee liability, public and products liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, and cybersecurity and technology-related losses. We do not insure against claims concerning patent litigation or other IP
infringement claims and potential related indemnification obligations, because we are of the view that any limited coverage that could be obtained would be prohibitively expensive. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and

rate, as well as the exchange rates to the euro and Indian rupee, may have a material impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition. To manage our exposure, we may engage in the use of financial derivatives or currency hedging
transactions, although such activities may not cover all of our exposure, may be costly and may also expose us to counterparty risk. Despite hedging and other mitigating techniques implemented by us, fluctuations in exchange rates have in the past

Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout this “Risk Factors” section, could significantly harm our brand and reputation. Our
reputation can be impacted by catastrophic events, incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct, product quality, security, or safety issues, allegations of legal noncompliance, internal control failures, corporate governance issues, data
breaches, workplace safety incidents, environmental issues, the use of our products for illegal or objectionable applications, including AI and ML or military applications that present ethical, regulatory, or other issues, marketing practices, media
statements, the conduct of our suppliers or representatives, and other issues, incidents, or statements that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity. To the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate
crises and other threats to our brand and reputation, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our brand and reputation, which could result in loss of trust from our customers, third-party partners and employees and could lead
to an increase in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, our brand and
reputation may be damaged by the actions of third parties that are imputed to us. For example, although Arm China operates independently of us, Arm China uses our trademarks in its marketing and branding. To the extent that Arm China’s actions
are imputed to us due to Arm China’s use of our trademarks, our own brand and reputation may suffer significant damage. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Damage to
our brand and reputation could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business, operating environment and the trading price of our securities. Damage to our reputation may also make us less attractive to current and prospective
employees relative to our competitors, particularly given the intensely competitive market for highly skilled employees. Moreover, repairing our brand and reputation may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. The heightened competitive
pressures could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in revenues or revenue growth rates, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </p>

processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have
a negative impact on the trading price of our securities and our access to and costs of capital. Increased ESG-related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory
requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and the trading price of our securities. New government regulations could also result in new or

accurately report our progress presents numerous operational, financial, legal, reputational and other risks, many of which are outside our control, and all of which could have a material negative impact on our business. Additionally, the
implementation of these initiatives imposes additional costs on us. If our ESG initiatives fail to satisfy investors, customers, partners and our other stakeholders, our reputation, our ability to license our products to customers, our ability to
attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner or acquirer could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfil our goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various

barriers. </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our headquarters are in the U.K., and we currently also have operations in various jurisdictions around the world,
including the U.S., the PRC, India, Canada, South Africa and Europe. We may in the future expand our operations either within these jurisdictions or to new jurisdictions. Risks associated with these international operations include exposure to
political, economic and financial conditions and expected and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory environments. We may, from time to time, enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or similar business relationships with entities in
foreign jurisdictions, including governmental or <font style="white-space:nowrap">quasi-governmental</font> entities, pursuant to which we may be required to license or transfer certain of our IP rights to such entities. Such relationships could
expose us to increased risks inherent in such activities, such as protection of our IP, economic and political risks, and contractual enforcement issues. In addition, we could face potentially adverse tax consequences from our international
expansion, changes in our international operations or changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate. Managing operations in multiple jurisdictions also places further strain on management’s time and our ability to

the future. In October 2022, the U.S. Government implemented export controls on advanced computing chips, computer commodities that contain such chips, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving
items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing <font style="white-space:nowrap">end-uses.</font> The new controls expand the scope of items subject to license requirements for certain entities on the U.S. Government’s Entity List (as
defined below). As a result, our freedom to license our products to designated countries or entities could be reduced, and our commercial relationships could be further harmed by limiting the ability of certain of our customers and partners from
freely shipping chips and end products incorporating certain of our products. For instance, given U.S. and U.K. trade and national security policies regarding exports of technology with potential military uses, it is unlikely that we would be able
to obtain a U.S. or U.K. export license for certain high performance compute cores in the Neoverse series processor family. This and any similar limitations could also reduce our revenues and cause significant uncertainty in our products roadmap,
which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, if other
countries, particularly the U.K., were to adopt export control rules similar to the U.S., or make existing rules more onerous, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, trade relations between countries where we do business or where our customers have end customers has recently been volatile. For
example, the U.S. Government has imposed export sanctions on certain trading partners and entities which impact the cross-border transfer of technology and software products and announced new licensing requirements which impact exports of some of
our customer’s ICs and certain related items. These measures may increase costs and/or reduce distribution in key markets. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to
increase prices to adequately address any restrictions, it could result in lower margins on products sold or fewer products sold, which would reduce royalties. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in, and could result in more, U.S. trading
partners adopting responsive trade policies, including imposition of increased tariffs, quotas or duties, or imposition of technology or financial sanctions or controls, making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those
countries. The implementation of a border tax, tariff or higher customs duties on products of our customers or their end customers manufactured outside of the U.S. or components that our customers or their end customers import into the U.S., or any
potential corresponding actions by other countries in which our customers or their end customers do business, could negatively impact our financial performance and/or ability to protect our IP. Such developments could also result in a decrease in
the demand for or injunctions on the products of our customers or their end customers, which would reduce our royalties and have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability and thereby on or business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects. See<i> </i>“—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our concentration of revenue from the PRC market makes us particularly susceptible to economic and political risks affecting the PRC, which could be

that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. In addition, inadequate systems and processes have in the past and could in the future result in
<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance</font> with applicable laws and regulations (and this can be particularly challenging in complex areas such as licensing and export controls). We may be required to incur significant expense to remedy
violations of these laws and regulations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to
suspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. For example, the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”), of the U.S. Department of Commerce, maintains and frequently
updates the “Entity List,” which limits our ability to deliver products and services to these entities, some of which are our customers. On May&nbsp;16, 2019, the BIS added Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and certain of its affiliated
entities to BIS’s Entity List, which imposes limitations on the supply of certain U.S. items and product support to Huawei and certain of its affiliated entities. Huawei remains on the Entity List, and in the absence of a license from BIS, we
may be unable to work with Huawei and certain of its affiliated entities on certain U.S. items and technology, which may have a negative effect on our ability to sell those U.S. items and technology in the future. Anticipated or actual changes in
trade restrictions could also affect customer purchasing behaviors. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><font style="white-space:nowrap">Non-compliance</font> with
applicable laws, regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if
we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected and our reputation and brand could be damaged. In addition, responding to
any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Actual

other jurisdictions where we operate and where the chips and end products incorporating our products are offered. The regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the
foreseeable future, which could expose us to further regulatory burdens. Many government bodies and agencies, including in the U.K., the European Union and the U.S., have adopted or are considering adopting or modifying laws and regulations
addressing privacy and data protection, including the collection, storage, transfer, use and other processing of personal information. In some cases, privacy and data protection laws, regulations and rules impose obligations directly on us as both a
data controller and a data processor (or the equivalents thereof), as well as on many of our customers. Certain jurisdictions have also </p>

enacted data localization laws mandating that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed primarily within that country. Laws, regulations and rules
relating to privacy and data protection continue to evolve in various jurisdictions, with existing laws, regulations and rules subject to new and differing interpretations and new laws, regulations and rules being proposed and adopted. It is
possible that our practices may be deemed not to comply with those privacy and data protection legal requirements that apply to us now or in the future. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the European Union and in the U.K., we are subject to the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR, respectively, which impose stringent obligations
regarding the collection, control, use, sharing, disclosure and other processing of personal data. Failure to comply with the GDPR or the U.K. GDPR can result in significant fines and other liability, including fines of up to €20&nbsp;million
(or £17.5&nbsp;million under the U.K. GDPR) or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater. European data protection authorities have already imposed fines for GDPR violations up to, in some cases, hundreds of millions of euros. While
the U.K. GDPR currently imposes substantially the same obligations as the GDPR, the U.K. GDPR will not automatically incorporate changes to the GDPR going forward (which would need to be specifically incorporated by the U.K. government), which
creates a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty. For example, in 2021, the European Commission announced an adequacy decision concluding that the U.K. ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides
some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to the U.K. This adequacy determination will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission renews or extends it
and may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot predict how the U.K. GDPR and other U.K. privacy and data protection laws, regulations or rules may develop, including as compared to the GDPR, nor can we predict the effects of divergent laws
and related guidance. Moreover, the U.K. government has publicly announced plans to reform the U.K. GDPR in ways that, if formalized, are likely to create a risk of divergent parallel regimes and related uncertainty, along with the potential for
increased compliance costs and risks for affected business. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, ongoing legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing
companies to transfer personal information from the EEA to outside the EEA (including the U.S.) could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new
agreements that support cross-border data transfers. While the European Commission adopted on July 10, 2023 an adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, enabling U.S. companies who certify to the
<font style="white-space:nowrap">EU-U.S.</font> Data Privacy Framework to rely on it as a valid data transfer mechanism, such adequacy decision is likely to face challenge at the Court of Justice of the European Union. While the EU-U.S. Data Privacy
Framework does not apply to the U.K., the U.K. and U.S. governments announced on June 8, 2023 a commitment in principle to establish a data bridge for the U.K. Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, to facilitate transfers of personal data
from the U.K. to the U.S. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, our business may be affected by laws, regulations, rules and standards aimed at regulating the use of
personal information for marketing purposes, the tracking of the online activities of individuals and the regulation of <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">machine-to-machine</font></font> communications. For example,
the European Union’s proposed ePrivacy Regulation, which is still being negotiated, may impose burdensome requirements around obtaining consent and impose fines for violations that are materially higher than those imposed under the European
Union’s current ePrivacy Directive and related EU member state legislation. Compliance with these laws, regulations, rules and standards may limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities and subject us to liabilities. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the U.S., we are subject to various federal, state and local privacy and data protection laws, rules, and regulations governing the
collection, sharing, use, retention, disclosure, security, transfer, storage and other processing of personal information. For example, at the state level, we are subject to the CCPA, which broadly defines personal information and gives California
residents expanded privacy rights and protections, such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for severe civil penalties
and statutory damages for violations and a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of unencrypted personal information. Numerous other states also have enacted, or are in the process of enacting or considering,

Colorado, Connecticut and Utah) having taken effect, or scheduled to take effect, in 2023. Additionally, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice to residents whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data
breach. Moreover, there is discussion in Congress of a new comprehensive federal privacy and data protection law to which we would become subject if it is enacted. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, we make public statements about our collection, use, disclosure and other processing of personal information through our privacy
policies and information on our website. Although we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other statements
that provide promises and assurances about privacy and data protection can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Any concerns about our privacy and
data protection practices, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we monitor the
regulatory environment and have invested in addressing new developments, we may be required to make additional changes to our services and business practices to enable us and our customers to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules,
standards and other obligations. Evolving regulatory and legal obligations may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance.</font> Laws, regulations, rules,
standards and other obligations relating to privacy and data protection are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, thereby making compliance with such obligations challenging. Revising our services and
business practices to comply with these requirements could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, or restrict our ability to store, transfer and otherwise process data or, in some cases,
impact our ability or our customers’ ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our products, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot assure you that any third-party partners with access to our employees’ personally identifiable and other sensitive or
confidential information in relation to which we are responsible will not breach contractual obligations imposed by us, or that they will not experience data security breaches or attempts thereof, which could have a corresponding effect on our
business, including putting us in breach of our obligations under privacy and data protection laws, regulations, rules, standards and other obligations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. We cannot assure you that our contractual measures and our own privacy and data protection-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and transmission of such information.
Increasing use of social media could also give rise to liability, breaches of data security or reputational damage. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our failure or
perceived failure to comply with any applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, rules, standards or other obligations could result in increased costs for our products, monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, government and
regulatory inquiries, investigations and enforcement actions, fines or legal action. Additionally, if our customers, third-party partners, vendors or developers violate applicable laws, regulations, rules or standards, or our policies or other
privacy or security-related obligations, such violations may also put the information of our customers, suppliers, third-party partners or employees at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may cause concerns regarding privacy and data protection and
may cause our customers or their customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet
regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

from offering or paying bribes, requesting or accepting bribes, or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Under the Bribery Act, we may also be
liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us from committing a bribery offense. We have operations in countries considered high risk for corruption, such as China and India, agreements and collaborations with third parties, interactions
with government officials, and other business activities that could expose us to corruption risk. While we have compliance safeguards in place, it is possible that these safeguards prove insufficient, or that our employees, intermediaries, or other <font style="white-space:nowrap">third-party</font> business partners may engage in activities that subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA, or other anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future
regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. If we further expand our operations internationally, we will need to dedicate additional
resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is no assurance that we
will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA, or other legal requirements. If we are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption
laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The SEC

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Disputes may arise between us and SoftBank Group or its affiliates in a number of areas,
including relating to arrangements with third parties that are exclusionary to us or SoftBank Group or its affiliates and business opportunities that may be attractive to both us and SoftBank Group or its affiliates. Furthermore, disputes may arise
between us and SoftBank Group or its affiliates with respect to Arm China. As of the date hereof, approximately 48% of the equity interest in Arm China is owned by Acetone Limited, which SoftBank Group controls and in which we own a 10% <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-voting</font> interest (representing an approximate 4.8% indirect interest). We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts with SoftBank Group and, even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we
were dealing with an unaffiliated party, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and the trading price of our ADSs. In addition, any disputes between us and SoftBank Group could distract our management. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, some of our directors and officers currently, and in the future may, directly or indirectly own equity interests in SoftBank
Group, and Mr.&nbsp;Son is also the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SoftBank Group and Mr.&nbsp;Haas is a director of SoftBank Group. In addition, Mr. Haas is party to an agreement pursuant to which he provides certain advisory and
consulting services to SoftBank Group. Ownership of such equity interests by our directors and officers and the presence of Messrs. Son and Haas, as the chair of our Board of Directors and our Chief Executive Officer and a director, respectively,
could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving both us and any one of them, or involving us and SoftBank Group. Provisions of the Articles address corporate opportunities that are presented to our
directors that are also directors or officers of SoftBank Group. We cannot assure you that the Articles will adequately address potential conflicts of interest or that potential conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor or that we will be
able to take advantage of corporate opportunities presented to individuals who are directors of both us and SoftBank Group. As a result, we may be precluded from pursuing certain advantageous transactions or growth initiatives. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, under the terms of the Shareholder Governance Agreement to be entered into with SoftBank Group upon the completion of this offering,
SoftBank Group has a contractual pre-emptive right. Specifically, under the terms of the Shareholder Governance Agreement, if we propose to allot or issue any ordinary or preferred shares or options, warrants or other securities convertible into or
exercisable for ordinary or preferred shares (including ADSs) (other than: (i) pursuant to an offer made to all ordinary shareholders on the same terms; or (ii) in connection with any incentive plan or share scheme otherwise approved by SoftBank
Group to the extent such approval is required under the Shareholder Governance Agreement), SoftBank Group will be entitled (but will not be obligated) to purchase up to an amount of the securities we propose to allot or issue such that it can
maintain its proportional legal and economic interests in our share capital prior to such allotment or issuance. As a result, while other holders of our ADSs would risk suffering a reduction in percentage ownership in connection with a new issuance
of securities by us, SoftBank Group will have the opportunity to avoid a reduction in its legal and economic interests. See “Related Party Transactions—Transactions with SoftBank Group—Shareholder Governance Agreement—Pre-emptive
Rights.” </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, regardless of the performance of our own business, SoftBank Group’s business, results of operations and
the trading price of SoftBank Group’s securities or other matters affecting SoftBank Group or actions that SoftBank Group may take may adversely affect the trading price of our ADSs. In addition, SoftBank Group is not restricted from competing
with us or otherwise taking for itself or its other affiliates certain corporate opportunities that may be attractive to us. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SoftBank
Group’s ability to control all matters submitted to our shareholders may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control, which could deprive holders of our ADSs of an opportunity to receive a premium for their ADSs as
part of a change of control, and might ultimately affect the fair market value of our ADSs. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>SoftBank Group has engaged, and may in the future

may be unable to influence the timing or terms of financing transactions by SoftBank Group involving our securities. For example, certain subsidiaries of SoftBank Group are parties to a term loan
facility described further under “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” pursuant to which we have certain obligations. SoftBank Group has informed us that (i) it intends to repay the term loan facility prior to, or
substantially concurrently with, the pricing of this offering, and (ii) at the time of such repayment, our springing guarantee and indemnity will be terminated. The repayment of the term loan facility and the release of our obligations thereunder is
a condition to the closing of this offering. If SoftBank Group does not repay this facility, this offering will not close. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition,
certain subsidiaries of SoftBank Group have entered into a margin loan facility, with certain of the underwriters or their affiliates being agents and/or lenders (which include Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citigroup Global
Markets Inc., Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Mizuho Securities USA LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc., Natixis Securities
Americas LLC, Santander US Capital Markets LLC and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. or their affiliates), to be secured by our outstanding ordinary shares and to be funded following, or substantially concurrently with, the closing of this
offering, but in any event after the Existing SoftBank Group Facility is repaid (the “New SoftBank Group Facility”). We have no material obligations with respect to the New SoftBank Group Facility. The New SoftBank Group Facility will
initially be secured by a pledge of 769,029,000 of our ordinary shares representing a 75.01% equity interest in us (before giving effect to the issuance of ordinary shares issuable upon the completion of this offering in connection with the vesting
of RSUs and Executive Awards) pursuant to certain exceptions to the lock-up agreements. See “Ordinary Shares and ADSs Eligible for Future Sale—Lock-up Agreements.” We face various risks in connection with such transactions. The New
SoftBank Group Facility contains, and such other financing transactions may contain, provisions that, subject to their terms, require prepayment if certain events or circumstances occur, including certain change of control transactions or in the
event the trading price of our ADSs declines below certain thresholds. From time to time, subject to certain requirements under the terms of the New SoftBank Group Facility and any other such financing transactions, SoftBank Group or the relevant
subsidiary of SoftBank Group, as applicable, may consider it advisable to sell shares in order to finance the prepayment or repayment of such financings, which number of shares may, individually or in the aggregate, be significant. In addition, in
connection with the New SoftBank Group Facility and any other such financings, if the price of our ADSs declines to certain levels, absent a repayment of the applicable financing, SoftBank Group may be required to provide additional collateral. For
instance, the New SoftBank Group Facility could be subject to a “margin call” by the providers of the facility if, among other events, the loan-to-value (LTV) exceeds a certain threshold. In the event of such a margin call, the relevant
subsidiary of SoftBank Group would need to deposit additional funds with the providers of the facility and may decide to sell some of the pledged shares to provide such funds. In the case of non-payment at maturity or another event of default, the
providers of the New SoftBank Group Facility and any other such financing may, in addition to other remedies, exercise their rights to foreclose on and sell or cause the sale of our shares that may be pledged as collateral. The foreclosure on our
shares that are initially pledged as collateral for the New SoftBank Group Facility could cause a change of control of us and if such shares are sold, such sales could cause the trading price of our ADSs to decline. Sales of our securities in
connection with the New SoftBank Group Facility and any other such financing transactions, whether by SoftBank Group or upon enforcement against collateral, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, access to
equity capital and the trading price of our ADSs. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>If SoftBank Group sells a controlling equity interest in our company to a third party in a

controlling equity interest or if a lender forecloses on a controlling interest pledged by SoftBank Group, including in connection with enforcement under the New SoftBank Group Facility, we may become subject to the control of a currently unknown
third party. The interests of this third party may not be the same as, or may conflict with, the interests of our other shareholders. Furthermore, if SoftBank Group sells a controlling equity interest in our company to a third party or a lender
forecloses on a pledged controlling equity interest in our company, our future indebtedness may be subject to acceleration, and our other commercial agreements and relationships, including any remaining agreements with SoftBank Group, could be
impacted. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </p>

right to designate a number of candidates for election to our Board of Directors depending on its and its affiliates’ level of ownership of our outstanding ordinary shares. SoftBank Group’s designation rights will range from the ability to
designate seven candidates so long as they own more than 70% of our outstanding ordinary shares (or up to eight if SoftBank Group exercises the right granted to it to increase the size of our Board of Directors and appoint an additional
non-independent director to fill the resulting vacancy) down to the ability to designate one candidate so long as they own more than 5% of our outstanding ordinary shares. The Shareholder Governance Agreement also provides SoftBank Group with
proportional rights to representation on the committees of our Board of Directors, subject to applicable restrictions. See “Related Party Transactions—Transactions with SoftBank Group—Shareholder Governance Agreement—Rights
Relating to Our Board of Directors.” Under these circumstances, qualified and experienced persons who might otherwise accept an invitation to join our Board of Directors may decline, which means that we would not be able to benefit from their

comply with the Exchange Act reporting and other requirements applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, which are more detailed and extensive than the requirements for foreign private issuers. We may also be required to make changes in our corporate
governance practices in accordance with various SEC and Nasdaq rules. The regulatory and compliance costs to us under U.S. securities laws if we are required to comply with the reporting requirements applicable to a U.S. domestic issuer may be
significantly higher than the cost we would incur as a foreign private issuer. As a result, we expect that a loss of foreign private issuer status would increase our legal and financial compliance costs and is likely to make some activities highly
time-consuming and costly. We also expect that if we were required to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, it would make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance,
and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors. </p>

duty reserve tax (“SDRT”) are expected to arise on either the transfer of ADSs into DTC’s facilities or on subsequent transfers of book-entry interests in ADSs entirely within DTC’s facilities. Similarly, on the basis of current
law and HMRC practice, a transfer of title in the ADSs from within the DTC clearance system to a purchaser out of the DTC clearance system and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC clearance system should not attract a charge
to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you choose to withdraw the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs (in accordance with the deposit agreement,

ADSs. We have received confirmation from HMRC that, in respect of the transactions contemplated by, and put in place as part of, this offering, no charge to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT should arise. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot assure you that the current legislation and/or HMRC guidance will not change. In particular, certain rights derived from European
Union law currently recognized in U.K. domestic law will cease to be so following December 31, 2023 as a result of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023, absent the exercise of a regulation-making power to restate or reproduce
specific rights in U.K. domestic law. Rights derived from European Union law, of this type, would therefore cease to restrict the application of the rules providing for the 1.5% U.K. stamp duty or SDRT charge. There has been no indication that these
European Union law rights will be restated or reproduced in U.K. domestic law before December 31, 2023. Accordingly, future issues or transfers of our ordinary shares to, or appropriations of our ordinary shares by, depositary receipt systems after
December 31, 2023 may be subject to 1.5% U.K. stamp duty or SDRT. The HMRC confirmation referred to above does not extend to such future transactions. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is also possible that, for example, in the future, a transfer of title in the ADSs from within the DTC clearance system to a purchaser out
of the DTC clearance system and/or any subsequent transfers of ADSs that occur entirely outside (or inside) the DTC clearance system, will attract a charge to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT. Any such U.K. stamp duty or SDRT will be chargeable at a rate of
0.5% (or potentially 1.5% in certain circumstances) of any consideration, which is normally payable by the transferee. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document, if any, stamped by HMRC) before the transfer can be registered in
the books of the depositary and, if relevant, ADSs issued to a nominee for DTC and corresponding book-entry interests credited in the facilities of DTC. </p>

Additionally, our shareholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. If a court were to find either choice of forum provision contained in the Articles to be inapplicable or unenforceable
in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The courts of England and Wales and the U.S. District Court for

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Risks Relating to this Offering and Ownership of Our Securities </b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>There has been no prior market for our ordinary shares or the ADSs and an active, liquid and orderly trading market may not develop for our ADSs or be
sustained following this offering, which could harm the market price of our ADSs and make it difficult for you to sell your ADSs. </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to this offering, there was no public trading market for our ordinary shares or ADSs. Although our ADSs are expected to be listed on
Nasdaq, an active trading market for our ADSs may never develop or be sustained following this offering. You may not be able to sell your ADSs quickly or at the then-current market price if trading in our ADSs is not active. The initial public
offering price was determined by negotiations among the lead underwriters, the selling shareholder and us. Among the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price were our future prospects and the prospects of our industry in
general, our revenue, net income and certain other financial and operating information in recent periods, and the market prices of securities and certain financial and operating information of companies engaged in activities similar to ours.
However, there can be no assurance that, following the completion of this offering, the ADSs will trade at a price equal to or greater than the public offering price. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>The purchase price paid by SoftBank Group to acquire shares in Arm Limited from SoftBank Vision Fund may not be, and should not be treated as,
indicative of the trading price of our ADSs following the completion of this offering. </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2023, a subsidiary of SoftBank
Group acquired substantially all of SoftBank Vision Fund’s approximately 25% interest in Arm Limited at a purchase price of approximately $16.1 billion, with the associated payments to be made in installments over a two-year period. The
purchase price for this transaction was established by reference to the terms of a prior contractual arrangement between the parties. Moreover, the transfer was part of a larger transaction that also involved transfers of certain other entities from
SoftBank Vision Fund to SoftBank Group. The consideration for such transfers is not included in the purchase price paid for the shares of Arm Limited. In light of the foregoing, investors are cautioned that the purchase price paid in respect of the
Arm Limited shares may not be indicative of, and is not intended to reflect, expectations regarding the trading price of our ADSs following the completion of this offering. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>The future exercise of registration rights by SoftBank Group may materially and adversely affect the market price of the ADSs. </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Shareholder Governance Agreement, SoftBank Group and certain of its affiliates are entitled to certain registration rights
pursuant to which they may demand that we register the resale of its ordinary shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares (including ADSs) (“Registrable Securities”) and, under certain circumstances, will also
have customary “piggyback” registration rights for its Registrable Securities in connection with certain registrations of securities by us. In addition, SoftBank Group or its relevant affiliates may require us to file and maintain an
effective shelf registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of SoftBank Group’s Registrable Securities. The registration of the resale of these securities will facilitate the public sale by SoftBank Group of such
securities without regard to any limitations on the volume of securities that SoftBank Group may sell. In light of SoftBank Group’s expected beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares after giving effect to this offering, the registration of
the resale of a significant number of ADSs, or the perception that significant sales by SoftBank Group may occur, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our ADSs. </p>

partnerships and alliances, and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, convertible debt securities or other equity-based derivative securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and

that may be senior to your rights as holder of ADSs. Any indebtedness we incur would result in increased payment obligations and could involve restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our
ability to incur additional debt and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any debt or additional equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our
shareholders. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our ADSs to decline and existing shareholders may not agree with our financing plans
or the terms of such financings. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships, collaborations, and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our IP or products, or grant
licenses on terms unfavorable to us. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our
securities. However, we cannot make rights available to holders in the U.S. unless we register the offer and sale of the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements
is available. Also, under the deposit agreement, the depositary bank will not make rights available to holders unless either both the rights and any related securities are registered under the Securities Act, or the distribution of them to ADS
holders is exempted from registration under the Securities Act. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities, to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective or
to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you may be unable to participate in such a rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market price of our ADSs following this offering could be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in
particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and the trading price of our ADSs may be volatile due to factors beyond our control. As a result of this volatility,
you may not be able to sell your ADSs at or above the initial public offering price. The market price for our ADSs may be influenced by many factors, including, among others: </p> <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</p>

not exceed the initial public offering price, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a

results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. We will not have any control over the analysts’ content and opinions included in their reports. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading
opinion regarding us, our business model, financial performance, ADS price or otherwise, our ADS price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose
visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause our ADS price or trading volume to decline and result in the loss of all or a part of your investment in us. </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ordinary shares outstanding. Of these shares, only the shares represented by ADSs sold in this offering by the selling shareholder, plus any shares
represented by ADSs sold upon the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ADSs, will be freely tradable without restriction in the public market immediately following this offering. In connection with this offering, our
officers, directors and the selling shareholder have agreed to be subject to a contractual <font style="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</font> with the underwriters, which will expire after the end of a <font style="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</font>
period, described in the sections titled “Ordinary Shares and ADSs Eligible for Future Sale” and “Underwriting.” If, upon the expiration of the <font style="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</font> period, or under any enforcement
pursuant to certain exceptions to the lock-up agreements, these shareholders sell substantial amounts of our ADSs in the public market or engage in financing transactions involving our ADSs or ordinary shares, or the market perceives that such
transactions may occur, the market price of our ADSs and our ability to raise capital through an issue of equity securities in the future could be adversely affected. In addition, in the case of non-payment at maturity or another event of default,
the providers of the New SoftBank Group Facility may exercise their rights to foreclose on and sell or cause the sale of our shares that may be pledged as collateral. If such shares are sold, then the market price of our ADSs could be adversely
affected. In the future, SoftBank Group may transfer a portion of its holdings in us to one or more of its affiliates or affiliated investment funds. Such affiliates or affiliated investment funds may have different investment strategies and
interests and may decide to sell their holdings to third parties even if SoftBank Group intends to continue to hold the remainder of its holdings. </p>

right of ADS holders to cancel their ADSs and withdraw the underlying ordinary shares. Temporary delays in the cancellation of your ADSs and withdrawal of the underlying ordinary shares may arise because the depositary has closed its transfer books
or we have closed our transfer books, the transfer of ordinary shares is blocked to permit voting at a shareholders’ meeting or we are paying a dividend on our ordinary shares. In addition, ADS holders may not be able to cancel their ADSs and
withdraw the underlying ordinary shares when they owe money for fees, taxes and similar charges and when it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals in order to comply with any laws or governmental regulations that apply to ADSs or to the withdrawal of
ordinary shares or other deposited securities. See “Description of American Depositary Shares.” </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>The depositary for our ADSs is entitled

underlying their ADSs. Otherwise, holders of ADSs will not have a right to vote unless they withdraw the ordinary shares underlying their ADSs to vote them in person or by proxy in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the Articles.
Even so, ADS holders may not know about a meeting far enough in advance to withdraw those ordinary shares. If we ask for the instructions of holders of the ADSs, the depositary, upon timely notice from us, will notify ADS holders of the upcoming
vote and arrange to deliver our voting materials to them. Upon our request, the depositary will mail to ADS holders a shareholder meeting notice that contains, among other things, a statement as to the manner in which voting instructions may be
given to the depositary. We cannot guarantee that ADS holders will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that they can instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares underlying their ADSs. A shareholder is only entitled to participate
in, and vote at, the meeting of shareholders, provided that it holds our ordinary shares as of the record date set for such meeting and otherwise complies with the Articles. In addition, the depositary’s liability to ADS holders for failing to
execute voting instructions or for the manner of executing voting instructions is limited by the deposit agreement. As a result, holders of ADSs may not be able to exercise their right to give voting instructions or be able to vote in person or by

Amendments may reflect, among other things, operational changes in the ADS program, legal developments affecting ADSs or changes in the terms of our business relationship with the depositary. In the event that the terms of an amendment are
materially disadvantageous to ADS holders, ADS holders will only receive 30&nbsp;days’ advance notice of the amendment, and no prior consent of the ADS holders is required under the deposit agreement. Furthermore, we may decide to direct the
depositary to terminate the ADS facility at any time for any reason. For example, terminations may occur if we decide to list our ordinary shares on a <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</font> securities exchange and determine not to continue
to sponsor an ADS facility or when we become the subject of a takeover or a <font style="white-space:nowrap">going-private</font> transaction. If the ADS facility will terminate, ADS holders will receive at least 30 days’ prior notice, but no
prior consent is required from them. Under the circumstances that we decide to make an amendment to the deposit agreement that is materially disadvantageous to ADS holders or terminate the deposit agreement, the ADS holders may choose to sell their
ADSs or surrender their ADSs and become direct holders of the underlying ordinary shares, but will have no right to any compensation whatsoever. </p>

connection with claims arising under the federal securities laws has not been finally adjudicated by the U.S. Supreme Court. However, it our understanding that a contractual <font style="white-space:nowrap">pre-dispute</font> jury trial waiver
provision is generally enforceable, including under the laws of the State of New York, which govern the deposit agreement, by a federal or state court in the City of New York, which has <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-exclusive</font>
jurisdiction over matters arising under the deposit agreement. In determining whether to enforce a contractual <font style="white-space:nowrap">pre-dispute</font> jury trial waiver provision, courts will generally consider whether a party knowingly,
intelligently and voluntarily waived the right to a jury trial. We believe that this is the case with respect to the deposit agreement and the ADSs. It is advisable that you consult legal counsel regarding the jury waiver provision before agreeing
to be a party to the deposit agreement. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you or any other holders or beneficial owners of ADSs bring a claim against us or the

which may have the effect of limiting and discouraging lawsuits against us and/or the depositary. If a lawsuit is brought against us and/or the depositary under the deposit agreement, it may be heard only by a judge or justice of the applicable
trial court, which would be conducted according to different civil procedures and may result in different outcomes than a trial by jury would have had, including results that could be less favorable to the plaintiff(s) in any such action, depending

registered office in England. The U.S. and the U.K. do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for
payment given by a court in the U.S., whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the U.K. In addition, uncertainty exists as to whether English courts would entertain original
actions brought in England and Wales against us or our directors or senior management predicated upon the securities laws of the U.S. or any state in the U.S. Any final and conclusive monetary judgment for a definite sum obtained against us in U.S.
courts would be treated by English courts as a cause of action in itself and sued upon as a debt at common law so that no retrial of the issues would be necessary, provided that certain requirements are met. Whether these requirements are met in
respect of a judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws, including whether the award of monetary damages under such laws would constitute a penalty is an issue subject to determination by the court making such
decision. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the English court discretion to
prescribe the manner of enforcement. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, U.S. investors may not be able to enforce against us or our senior management, Board of
Directors or certain experts named herein who are residents of the U.K. or countries other than the U.S. any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities laws. </p>

our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual and current reports with
respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required,
improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other

in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance
practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from
revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory
authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also expect that being a public company combined
with these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors also

will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do
not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. </p>

or total combined voting power of our stock, such U.S. investor may be treated as a “United States shareholder” with respect to each CFC in our group, if any, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A
<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</font> corporation will generally be classified as a CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if United States shareholders own, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 50% of either the total
value or the total combined voting power of the stock of such corporation. Because SoftBank Group currently owns, and immediately after this offering will continue to own, more than 50% of our ordinary shares, we will be a CFC at the time of this
offering or in the future if SoftBank Group owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more (by value) of the stock of a U.S. subsidiary. In addition, because our group includes U.S. subsidiaries, our current
<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</font> subsidiaries and potentially any future newly formed or acquired <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</font> subsidiaries generally will be treated as CFCs, regardless of whether we are treated
as a CFC. A United States shareholder of a CFC may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of “Subpart F income,” “global intangible <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-taxed</font>
income” and investments of earnings in U.S. property, regardless of whether such CFC makes any distributions to its shareholders. Additionally, an individual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a CFC generally would not be
allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a United States shareholder that is a U.S. corporation. Failure to comply with CFC reporting obligations may also subject a United States shareholder to significant
monetary penalties and may prevent the statute of limitations with respect to such United States shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the year for which reporting was due from expiring. We cannot provide any assurances that we will
furnish to any United States shareholder information that may be necessary to comply with the reporting and tax paying obligations applicable under the CFC rules of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the United

U.S. investors. </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In general, we will be a PFIC for any taxable year in which, after the application of certain look-through rules
with respect to our subsidiaries, either (1) 75% or more of our gross income consists of passive income or (2) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of our assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive
income (including cash and cash equivalents). For purposes of these tests, passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, gains from certain sales or exchanges of investment property and certain rents and royalties. If
we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. investor holds our shares, we will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. investor for all succeeding taxable years during which such U.S. investor holds our
ordinary shares or ADSs, even if we cease to meet the threshold requirements for PFIC status. Such U.S. investor may be subject to adverse tax consequences with respect to our ordinary shares or ADSs, including ineligibility for any preferential tax
rates on capital gains or on actual or deemed dividends, interest charges on certain taxes treated as deferred and additional reporting requirements. We cannot provide any assurance that we will furnish to such U.S. investor information that may be
necessary to comply with the reporting and tax paying obligations applicable under the PFIC rules of the Code. Such U.S. investor should consult its tax advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to their investment in our ordinary
shares or ADSs. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based upon the value of our assets and the nature and composition of our income and assets, we expect that we will not be
classified as a PFIC for the taxable year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, although no assurances can be made in this regard. However, the determination of whether we are a PFIC is a fact-intensive determination made on an annual basis applying principles
and methodologies that in some circumstances are unclear and subject to varying interpretation. For instance, for our current and future taxable years, the total value of our assets (including goodwill) for PFIC testing purposes may be determined in
part by reference to the market price of our ordinary shares or ADSs from time to time, which may fluctuate considerably. If our market capitalization declines while we hold a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents for any taxable year, we
may be a PFIC for that taxable year. Furthermore, under the income test, our status as a PFIC depends on the composition of our income for the relevant taxable year, which will depend on the transactions we enter into in the future and our corporate
structure. The composition of our income and assets is also affected by how we spend the cash we raise in any offering. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not be treated as a PFIC for the current or any future taxable year and our
U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to our PFIC status for any prior, current or future taxable year. Even if we determine that we are not a PFIC for a taxable year, there can be no&nbsp;assurance that the IRS will agree with our
conclusion and that the IRS would not successfully challenge our&nbsp;position. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For further discussion of the PFIC rules and the adverse
U.S. federal income tax consequences in the event we are classified as a PFIC, as well as certain elections that may be available to U.S. investors, see the section of this prospectus titled “Material Tax Considerations—Material U.S.

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (“OECD”) and the G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit
Shifting (the “Inclusive Framework”) have put forth two proposals—Pillar One and Pillar Two—that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and ensure a minimal level of taxation, respectively. In July 2023, the U.K.
enacted legislation to implement the OECD framework for Pillar 2, part of which will apply effectively from January 1, 2024. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the Inclusive
Framework’s proposals. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. These changes, if enacted into law,
could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows. We are continuing to monitor legislative developments and are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the U.K. and other legislation on our
financial position, future results of operations and cash flows. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable, but the
ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods in which such outcome is determined. We are unable to predict what tax reform may be
proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase
the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our financial statements, and otherwise affect our financial position, future results of operations, cash flows in a particular period and overall or effective tax
rates in the future in countries where we have operations, reduce <font style="white-space:nowrap">post-tax</font> returns to our shareholders and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance. Additionally, our future tax liability
could be impacted by changes in accounting principles or changes in applicable tax jurisdictions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we may periodically
restructure our legal entities and if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our tax liability could be materially affected. In connection with any restructuring we could also incur
additional charges associated with consulting fees and other charges. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We carry out extensive research and development activities, and as
a result, we benefit in the U.K. from the research and development expenditure credit (“RDEC”) regime, which provides relief against U.K. corporation tax. Broadly, RDEC provides a tax credit currently equal to 20% of ‘qualifying
research and development expenditure’ incurred from April&nbsp;1, 2023 (the rate was previously 13% of qualifying research and development expenditure incurred from April&nbsp;1, 2020 to March&nbsp;31, 2023) by certain companies where certain
criteria are met. To the extent a company cannot utilize the RDEC against U.K. corporation tax then certain rules apply that allow the RDEC to, among other things, reduce the tax liability of certain specified taxes (for example, value added tax or
employee taxes), or be surrendered to a group company, and to the extent it is not possible to utilize the RDEC in full, then the net tax credit is paid to the company by HMRC in cash. Between January 2023 and March 2023, the U.K. government ran a
consultation on the design of a single, simplified R&amp;D tax relief scheme, expected to be based on the RDEC scheme, which would merge the existing RDEC and small and <font style="white-space:nowrap">medium-sized</font> enterprise R&amp;D relief.
The U.K. government is considering the responses and no decision has yet been made. We expect that, if implemented, the new scheme will be in place for expenditures incurred after April&nbsp;1, 2024. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also benefit from the U.K.’s “patent box” regime, which allows certain profits attributable to revenues from patented
products (and other qualifying income) to be taxed at an effective corporation tax rate of 10%. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If, however, there are unexpected adverse
changes to the RDEC or the “patent box” regime (including any such changes which result from the U.K. government’s response to its consultation on the design of a single, simplified R&amp;D tax relief scheme), or for any reason we are
unable to qualify for such tax incentives, then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. </p>

applicable laws and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks<b> </b>Relating to this Offering and Ownership of Our Securities—Because we do not anticipate paying any cash

on a <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-consolidated</font> basis), which are our accumulated realized profits that have not been previously distributed or capitalized less our accumulated realized losses, so far as such losses have not been
previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. In addition, as a public limited company in England, we will only be able to make a distribution if the amount of our net assets is not less than the aggregate of our called-up
share capital and undistributable reserves and if, and to the extent that, the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate. </p>

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;9, 2018, Arm Holdings Limited was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arm Limited under the laws of England and Wales
with nominal assets and liabilities, contingencies and commitments. After consummating the corporate reorganization described herein, including the <font style="white-space:nowrap">re-registration</font> of Arm Holdings Limited as a public limited
company, Arm Holdings plc became the ultimate holding company for Arm Limited. Arm Limited in turn was incorporated as a private company with limited liability under the laws of England and Wales on November&nbsp;12, 1990. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm Holdings plc is a holding company which, since formation, has not conducted any operations other than activities incidental to the
maintenance of its legal existence, the corporate reorganization and this offering. Investors in this offering will only acquire, and this prospectus only describes the offering of, ADSs representing ordinary shares of Arm Holdings plc. Ordinary
shares of Arm Holdings plc will not be offered to investors as part of this offering. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The corporate reorganization took place in several
steps, all of which were completed prior to the completion of this offering. We refer to these steps, which are discussed below, as our “corporate reorganization.” </p>

permit its merger reserve to legally be used to pay up the shares allotted as a bonus issue, and to allow the creation of a new class of deferred shares (which carry no or extremely limited voting rights, and no right to share in the income or
capital of Arm Holdings Limited). On &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2023, Arm Holdings Limited undertook a reorganization of its share capital to <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-divide</font> its share
capital of 100 ordinary shares of £1.00 each into 100,000 ordinary shares of £0.001 each. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Distribution of Ordinary Shares of Arm Holdings

100,000 ordinary shares of £0.001 each in the capital of Arm Holdings Limited (such number of shares together constituting 100% of the ordinary shares of Arm Holdings Limited) to Kronos II LLC, Arm Limited’s majority shareholder
immediately prior to the distribution. We refer to the shares of Arm Holdings Limited distributed to Kronos II LLC as the “Dividend Shares.” </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2023, Kronos II LLC transferred its entire shareholding in the capital of Arm Limited, being 1,025,233,999 ordinary shares of £0.001 each, to Arm Holdings Limited in

share of £0.001, to Arm Holdings Limited in exchange for receiving one newly issued ordinary share of £0.001 in the capital of Arm Holdings Limited. We refer to this as the “Share Exchange.” Following the Share Exchange, the
former holders of shares in Arm Limited now hold shares in Arm Holdings Limited of the same class and in the same proportions as their previous shareholdings in Arm Limited. Arm Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arm Holdings Limited as a
result of the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share Exchange, an English company law merger reserve in Arm Holdings Limited was created. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>First

after the Capital Reduction, Kronos II LLC and SVF HoldCo (UK) Limited held 1,025,233,999 ordinary shares of £0.001 each, which we refer to as the “Post-Reduction Shares,” and one ordinary share of £0.001, respectively, in the

licenses high-performance, <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-cost,</font> and energy-efficient CPU products and related technology, on which many of the world’s leading semiconductor companies and OEMs rely to develop their products. Our
energy-efficient CPUs have enabled advanced computing in greater than 99% of the world’s smartphones, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and more than 250&nbsp;billion chips, cumulatively, powering everything from the tiniest of sensors to
the most powerful supercomputers. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We enable any company to make a modern computer chip through the unique combination of our <font style="white-space:nowrap">energy-efficient</font> CPU IP and related technologies and our unmatched ecosystem of technology partners. Our primary product offerings are leading CPU products that address diverse performance, power, and cost
requirements. Complementary products such as GPUs, System IP, and compute platforms are also available and enable high-performance, efficient, reliable, system-level creation for a wide range of increasingly sophisticated devices and applications.
Our development tools and robust software ecosystem have further solidified our position as the world’s most widely adopted processor architecture. Our partners include leading semiconductor technology suppliers (including foundries and EDA
vendors), firmware and operating system vendors, game engine vendors, software tool providers and application software developers. Our solution, combined with the breadth of our software ecosystem and the millions of chip design engineers and
software developers that utilize it, has created a virtuous cycle of adoption, which means that software developers write software for <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> devices because it offers the biggest market for their products,
and chip designers choose Arm processors because they have the broadest support of software applications. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Today, Arm CPUs run the vast
majority of the world’s software, including the operating systems and applications for smartphones, tablets and personal computers, data centers and networking equipment, and vehicles, as well as the embedded operating systems in devices such
as smartwatches, thermostats, drones and industrial robotics. The exponential rise in smart devices in both consumer and enterprise markets has increased the demand for chips that provide more computational capability while optimizing for energy
efficiency. This trend has driven the dramatic growth of Arm CPUs over the past several years. The scale of our reach continues to expand, with more than 30&nbsp;billion <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chips reported as shipped in
the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 alone, representing an approximately 70% increase since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our creation of the Arm CPU architecture, the world’s most widely used CPU architecture, has resulted in the proliferation and evolution
of computers as people know them today. We enabled the mobile phone and smartphone revolution, and through our focus on energy efficiency and our history of continuous innovation, we have enabled new categories of “smart” consumer
electronics. Today, we are redefining what is possible in industries such as cloud computing, automotive, and IoT. As a result, in the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, more than 260 companies reported that they had shipped <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chips, and we estimate that approximately 70% of the world’s population uses <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> products. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have long-standing, significant market share in high-value markets, such as mobile applications processors, which enables us to invest in

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, most customers licensed our products under the terms of a TLA. In 2019 and
2021, we introduced the Arm Flexible Access and Arm Total Access agreements, respectively, to enable the widest range of customers to access our products through methods best suited to their particular business needs. We believe that the Arm Total
Access and Arm Flexible Access agreements provide enhanced flexibility for our customers (as compared to the TLA business model) and increase the number of chip designs using our products. While certain customers will elect to remain TLA customers,
some customers are in the process of transitioning from TLAs to Arm Total Access and Arm Flexible Access agreements. We may experience variability in license revenues due to the timing of product deliveries within each TLA, Arm Total Access and Arm
Flexible Access agreement. However, because Arm Total Access and Arm Flexible Access agreements are renewable in nature, as customers transition away from TLAs, we expect our visibility into future license revenues to improve. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We typically are able to command a royalty for chips that contain our products, which creates a long-term recurring revenue opportunity from
each design win. We typically see sustained revenue streams from older chips, as products containing those chips continue to be sold and older processors are incorporated into new chips, creating a cumulative effect that fuels long-term growth. For
example, based on royalty revenue information provided to us by customers in quarterly royalty reports, approximately 46% of our royalty revenue for the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 came from products released between 1990 to 2012.
Additionally, as we transition to more Arm Total Access and Arm Flexible Access licenses, we expect more of our products to be incorporated into more of our customers’ chip designs, and our royalty revenue to increase over time as a result.

industry has experienced significant, prolonged, and sometimes sudden downturns in the past, we expect there to be continued and increasing demand for semiconductors over the long term as macro trends drive device manufacturers to produce more
powerful and energy-efficient devices. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because our royalty revenue is dependent on the number of
<font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-powered</font> chips shipped by our customers, dislocations created by cyclical, economic factors generally affect demand for our customers’ chips and, consequently, may result in variability in our
operating performance. Royalties are recognized on an accrual basis in the quarter in which the customer ships products incorporating our products. A material portion of the accrual is estimated using trend analysis of market and sales data as well
as customer-specific financial information with a <font style="white-space:nowrap">true-up</font> in the following quarter based on actual sales data once received. Accordingly, differences between our estimated market trends and our customers’
forecasts of their chip shipments can lead to variability in our royalty revenues. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Our Market Share Across End Markets </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm CPUs are the world’s most widely licensed and deployed processors. Our products are used in almost all smartphones, the majority of
tablets and digital TVs, and a significant proportion of all chips with embedded processors, including for both consumer and enterprise applications. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a greater than 99% share of the smartphones market and
a very high share in a range of other electronic devices, from digital TVs to drones. As new high-growth markets for electronics emerge and incorporate more AI and ML workloads, they require our more advanced processor designs in areas such as cloud
computing, the automotive industry, and the IoT economy. Our operating and financial performance is dependent, in large part, upon maintaining our market share in the smartphone and consumer electronics markets and maintaining or growing market
share in our other target markets. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Ability to Provide Our Customers with More Value Per Chip </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe our ability to continue to develop more advanced products and offer increasingly comprehensive product packages, including providing
more complete subsystems, will encourage greater use of our products by existing and prospective customers. For example, some licensees may combine multiple different Arm CPUs in a single chip, Arm CPUs with other Arm IP such as Arm GPUs, or deploy
Arm CPU implementations with more than 100 cores. Some customers may be better served by the integration of our IP into a subsystem with additional information to assist in fabrication. For chips where our products have provided more value, we will
typically receive a higher royalty rate per chip. Accordingly, we believe that our investments in higher performance, higher efficiency, and more specialized designs will drive greater demand for our products and higher value for our customers,
which is expected to result in higher royalty fees. Our future performance is dependent on our continued ability to provide value to customers, and our ability to drive additional value through technological innovation. </p>

suitable for new opportunities with existing and prospective customers. A key measure of our success is our customer design wins. Because we are often embedded within our customers’ R&amp;D functions, we typically have significant, unique
visibility into our customers’ product development pipelines, which we believe positions us to capture design wins to a greater extent than our competitors. A “design win” occurs when a customer decides to include an Arm CPU product
or related technology within one of their chip designs. For customers who already license our products, a new design win does not necessarily require a customer to sign a new license. By licensing a portfolio of Arm products to our customers (rather
than licensing a single CPU design or other technology design), we have made it easier and more compelling for </p>

depend on our commercial relationship with Arm China to access the PRC market, and a significant portion of our total revenue is generated from Arm China, a related party. Arm China has the right to sublicense our processor technology pursuant to
the IPLA. Our responsibility under the IPLA is to facilitate delivery of our processor technology to Arm China’s end customers in accordance with detailed instructions and other specifications from Arm China. For additional information
regarding the IPLA, see “Business—The IPLA with Arm China.” Our revenue is calculated as a percentage of license and royalty fees earned by Arm China from <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-license</font> arrangements entered into
with its end customers. Where our revenue is earned as a percentage of the license fee received by Arm China, we categorize such revenue as our license revenue. Our share of Arm China’s royalties is categorized as Royalties in our financial
statements. Despite our significant reliance on Arm China through our commercial relationship with them, both as a source of revenue and as a conduit to the important PRC market, Arm China operates independently of us. Under the IPLA, Arm
China’s payments due to us are determined based on the financial information that Arm China provides to us. Accordingly, we are dependent on Arm China providing us with reliable and timely financial information. Additionally, political actions,
including trade and national security policies of the U.S. and PRC governments, such as tariffs, placing companies on restricted lists, or new end-use controls, have in the past, currently do and could in the future limit or prevent us, directly or
through our commercial relationship with Arm China, from transacting business with certain PRC customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain PRC customers or suppliers from transacting business with us or Arm China, or make it more
expensive to do so, which could adversely affect demand for our products. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, although our total revenues derived from the PRC increased as compared to the prior year, the growth in our royalty revenues slowed
for the same period primarily as a result of economic issues in the PRC and factors related to export control and national security matters. Furthermore, in light of these issues, we expect to continue to see declining royalty revenues derived from
the PRC and we could see a decline in licensing revenues. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our concentration of revenue from the PRC market makes us particularly susceptible to economic and political risks
affecting the PRC, which could be exacerbated by tensions between (on the one hand) the U.S. or the U.K. and (on the other hand) the PRC with respect to trade and national security.” </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2022, the BIS of the U.S. Department of Commerce published changes to U.S. export control regulations that restrict the PRC’s
semiconductor and supercomputing industries’ ability to obtain advanced computing chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and technology used to develop and maintain supercomputers and manufacture advanced semiconductors. We have been
impacted by the implementation in October 2022 of rules by the BIS, which principally relate to (i)&nbsp;implementing new process requirements that require licensees to disclose semiconductor manufacturing facilities used for manufacturing <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> integrated circuit designs; and (ii)&nbsp;controlling previously <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-controlled</font> Arm interconnect IP as well as releasing a modified version of such IP that does not
exceed the BIS performance thresholds for the PRC. We anticipate additional changes to U.S. export control regulations in the future, but we cannot forecast the scope or timing of such changes. We will continue to monitor such developments,
including potential additional trade restrictions, and other regulatory or policy changes by the U.S. and foreign governments. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Impact of the

in Arm China. In March 2022, we distributed our interest in Arm China to Acetone Limited, a company under control of SoftBank Group, our controlling shareholder, for contractual consideration of approximately $930 million. We retained a 10% <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-voting</font> shareholding interest in Acetone Limited, which represents an approximate 4.8% indirect interest in Arm China. As a result of these transactions, we recognized a net distribution to our immediate
shareholders of $976&nbsp;million. Our indirect equity interest in Arm China is recorded in income from equity investments, net on the Consolidated Income Statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. See “Related Party

certain components of our IoT business to subsidiaries of SoftBank Group. In June 2021, we distributed all of the equity interests in Treasure Data, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Treasure Data”) to our shareholders, and in November 2021 we
sold Pelion IOT Limited and its subsidiaries (“IoTP”) to SoftBank Group Capital Limited. Treasure Data’s and IoTP’s net assets upon distribution and sale were approximately $44&nbsp;million and $12&nbsp;million, respectively.
Upon distribution and sale, Treasure Data and IoTP qualified for classification as discontinued operations and therefore the results of operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all historical periods. Following the disposals
we do not have significant involvement with either company. During the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized net losses from discontinued operations of $127&nbsp;million and $156&nbsp;million, respectively. Included in net

reports received in the 12-month period from April 1 to March 31 of each year relate to chip shipments made in the period from January 1 to December 31 of each year. We also perform various procedures to assess customer data related to royalties for
reasonableness, and our license agreements generally include rights for us to audit the books and records of our customers to verify certain types of customer data. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We consider the number of chips reported as shipped by our customers as a key performance indicator because it represents the acceptance of

revenue in the future, improving our long-term market share. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Annualized Contract Value </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each quarter, we track the annualized contract value (“ACV”) relating to licensing agreements signed with our customers and those
contracted through Arm China per the aggregate license fee as shared under the IPLA. We define ACV as the total annualized committed fees, excluding any potential future royalty revenue, for all signed agreements deemed to be active through the last
day of each applicable reporting period. Arm Total Access agreements and ALAs are deemed to be active for, and annualized over, the number of years in the contract. Any other license agreements, including single use and limited use licenses issued
under an Arm Flexible Access agreement or TLA, are deemed to be active for, and annualized over, three years based on the historical licensing patterns of our customers. The aggregate license fee shared by Arm China is also deemed to be active for,
and annualized over, three years. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ACV is an operational metric based on committed fees, excluding royalties, not recognized revenue, and
therefore is not reconcilable to, nor a substitute for, revenue reported under GAAP. However, we consider ACV to be a key operational metric that we use to track existing licensing commitments with our customers. Bookings of new licenses and
recognized revenue may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter due to customer buying patterns, timing of subscription renewals and as a function of contract duration. As a result, we believe ACV provides an additional understanding of our
business performance and long-term trends. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Non-GAAP Financial Measures </i></b></p>

believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity position. We use the non-GAAP financial measures presented below, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing performance and for internal planning,
forecasting and budgeting purposes. We believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed holistically, is helpful to investors in assessing the consistency and comparability of our performance in relation to prior periods
and facilitates comparisons of our financial performance relative to our competitors, particularly with respect to competitors that present similar non-GAAP financial measures in addition to their GAAP results. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental information purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial

and income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments. We exclude these items from our Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations measure because they are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items
is unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations provide useful information
to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP

For non-GAAP purposes, we adjust for those awards that are currently liability-classified but will be equity settled after the

have two components: license fees and support and maintenance fees (recognized as license and other revenue) and <font style="white-space:nowrap">per-chip</font> royalties (recognized as royalty revenue). However, some licenses can have multiple
payment milestones that are date-based or event-based (e.g., six months after the effective date of the contract or upon <font style="white-space:nowrap">tape-out</font> of the first chip design). </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We disaggregate revenue into the following major categories: </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>License and Other Revenue </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">License and other revenue includes revenue from licensing, software development tools, design services, training, support, and all other fees
that do not constitute royalty revenue. The products licensed by us consists of design information and related documentation to enable a customer to design and manufacture semiconductor chips and related technology. Over the term of a license,
contractual payments can generally range from hundreds of thousands of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the type of license, its duration, and the type of product that is being licensed. A license may be perpetual, <font style="white-space:nowrap">use-limited</font> or time-limited in its application. Delivery (i.e., providing the customer access to the licensed products) generally occurs within a short period after executing a license agreement. In some cases, we
may license products that are still under development, in which case delivery can be many months, or even years, after executing a license agreement. We generate a significant proportion of our Licensing and other revenues from a relatively small
number of customers. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">License fees are invoiced pursuant to an agreed schedule. Typically, the first invoice is generated upon signing of
the license agreement, and licensing and other revenue is recognized upon delivery of the products. In addition to the license fees, our license agreements generally provide for customer support services, which consist of telephonic or <font style="white-space:nowrap">e-mail</font> support. Fees for customer support services are generally specified in the contract. Typically, no upgrades to the licensed products are provided, except those updates and upgrades provided on a <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">when-and-if-available</font></font></font> basis. Revenues from customer service support are recorded within other revenues. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm Flexible Access agreements provide our customers with access to a wide range of processor, graphics, and systems products, especially
older and less performant products. Arm Flexible Access agreements have two components: an annual <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-cost</font> portfolio license fee payable in installments and a license fee once they have reached <font style="white-space:nowrap">“tape-out,”</font> which occurs when the final result of our customer’s semiconductor chip design incorporating our products is sent for manufacturing, at which point they decide which of our products they
wish to deploy in their chip. We believe that Arm Flexible Access agreements are most suitable for smaller companies, including <font style="white-space:nowrap">start-ups</font> and business units of larger companies, that want to experiment with
different configurations of our products before committing to a chip design. As of June 30, 2023, we had 214 extant Arm Flexible Access agreements with our customers, reflecting an increase of 85 from 129 as of March 31, 2021. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm Total Access agreements also provide our customers with access to a package of our products, including processor, graphics, and systems
products. Arm Total Access customers have the option to license our most advanced processors as part of the package. Arm Total Access customers pay a periodic portfolio license fee to maintain access to our products. There are no additional fees
payable by our customers under our Arm Total Access agreements upon <font style="white-space:nowrap">tape-out</font> because manufacturing design rights are included within the portfolio license fee and are reflected in the license pricing. We
believe that Arm Total Access agreements are most suitable for larger, established, semiconductor companies who expect to deploy our products in a wide range of their products. As of June 30, 2023, we had 20 extant Arm Total Access agreements with
our customers, reflecting an increase of 16 from 4 as of March 31, 2021. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We provide software development tools and a range of services to

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Royalties are generally either set as a percentage of the licensee’s average selling price per chip or as a fixed amount per chip. The
royalty rates per chip typically reduce over time as the total volume of chips incorporating our products shipped increases; notwithstanding such reductions in royalty rates and fees per chip, license agreements with component manufacturing
customers typically include a minimum royalty percentage or fee per chip. Royalty payment schedules in individual license agreements vary depending on the nature of the license and the degree of market acceptance of our products on the date the
license agreement is executed. In addition, the amount of royalty payments in respect of our products can increase as the customer integrates more of our products into the chip. See “—Key Factors and Trends Affecting Our Operating
Results—Ability to Provide Our Customers with More Value Per Chip” above for examples of how customers may incorporate multiple products in a single chip. License contracts require the licensee to issue royalty reports, including details
of chip sales, to us on a quarterly basis. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Royalty revenue is recognized on an accrual basis in the quarter in which the customers ship
chips containing our products, using an estimate based on sales trends and judgment for several key attributes, including industry estimates of expected shipments, the percentage of markets using our products, and average selling price (with a <font style="white-space:nowrap">true-up</font> in the following quarter based on actual sales data once received). </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Revenues from External
Customers and Related Parties </i></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also separately present revenues derived from contracts with our external customers and those derived
from related parties. Revenues from related parties are derived from Arm China and customers in which we have an equity method investment. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Cost of
Sales </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cost of sales (“COS”) is comprised primarily of the costs of providing technical support and training to our
customers. Occasionally, some Research and Development costs may be classified as COS if one of our IP products is being customized as part of professional and design services. COS expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, project
costs associated with professional services and the provision of support and maintenance to customers, along with expenses related to license development services revenue, amortization of developed technology, and allocated overhead.
Employee-related expenses include salaries, bonuses, share-based compensation and associated benefits. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Research and Development </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development is at the heart of our business and critical to our future success. Accordingly, we have always invested, and will
continue to invest, significant resources in our R&amp;D program. Our vision to invest and develop new products is driven by our desire to maintain or increase our market share and create value for our customers. By developing and licensing
innovative products, we allow our customers to focus their resources on competitive differentiation, unique to their own ability to differentiate. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have substantially increased our R&amp;D investment to focus on long-term returns and to replicate the strong position that we maintain in
smartphones and in other markets, such as automotive, networking equipment, cloud compute and industrial IoT. Each generation of processor is typically more advanced and more complex than the previous generation, which requires increased development
efforts that may be partially offset by improvements in productivity. Consequently, each year we increase our R&amp;D investment in line with the increased development needs of the next generation of products. Engineers are in high demand and
well-remunerated, and accordingly our increased R&amp;D activity will continue to result in an increase in costs, principally driven by salaries for such technical employees and the costs of tools they need. </p>

bonuses, share-based compensation, and benefits associated with employees in research and development functions, along with project materials costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, depreciation and amortization, allocated overhead, information
technology and other development expenses. We receive government grants to compensate for certain research activities and we recognize the benefit as a reduction of the related expenses included in R&amp;D expenses. </p>

consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, share-based compensation, and benefits associated with employees in sales and marketing, along with corporate and administrative functions, including accounting and legal
professional services fees, depreciation and amortization, advertising expenses, allocated overhead, information technology and other corporate-related expenses. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, we have invested in new systems for our commercial and finance teams to streamline our operations and create efficiencies. In
March 2022, we announced a restructuring plan to align our selling, general and administrative workforce with strategic business activities. The expenses associated with this plan are included within “Disposal, restructuring and other operating
expenses, net” in the consolidated income statements and consist of employee termination benefits and other related costs. Disposal expenses consist primarily of transaction costs, such as legal and professional fees, relating to various
disposal activities. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Restructuring and other operating expenses consist primarily of employee termination benefits. Recognition of costs
for employee termination benefits depends on whether employees are required to render service beyond a minimum retention period in order to receive the termination benefits. If employees are required to render service beyond a minimum retention
period in order to receive the termination benefits, costs are recognized ratably over the applicable future service period. Otherwise, costs are recognized when the Company has committed to a restructuring plan and has communicated those actions to
employees. Employee termination benefits covered by existing benefit arrangements are recognized when the Company has committed to a restructuring plan and the termination benefits are probable and estimable. </p>

than anticipated operating results and a deterioration in projected results. For purposes of determining the impairment, we relied on the income approach utilizing discounted cash flows to arrive at fair value. </p>

fair value accounting or at the net asset value, our proportionate share of equity method investee income or loss for certain equity method investments, and gains and losses on other marketable and
<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-marketable</font> securities. Our proportionate share of income or loss from equity method investments accounted for under the equity method under GAAP and is recognized in the quarter following the quarter in

Income tax expense reflects income earned and taxed, in jurisdictions in which we conduct business, which mainly include U.K. and U.S. federal and state income taxes. We benefit from the U.K.’s “patent box” regime, which allows
certain profits attributable to revenue from patented products (and other qualifying income) to be taxed at an effective corporation tax rate of 10%. </p>

2022, respectively. License and other revenue was $275&nbsp;million and $258&nbsp;million for the fiscal quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in license and other revenues was primarily driven by new licensing deals
as well as renewals of our existing license arrangement by customers to gain access to the latest versions of our technology IPs. Royalty revenue was approximately $400&nbsp;million and approximately $434&nbsp;million for the fiscal quarters ended
June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in royalty revenue was driven primarily by the macroeconomic slowdown and lower shipments to normalize inventory levels. </p>

ended June&nbsp;30, 2022, driven primarily by a $33&nbsp;million increase in license and other revenue, which was partially offset by a $22&nbsp;million decrease in royalty revenue. Revenue from related parties decreased by $28&nbsp;million during
the fiscal quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 as compared to the fiscal quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2022, primarily driven by a $16&nbsp;million decrease in license and other revenue and a $12&nbsp;million decrease in royalty revenue as a result of
trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and PRC governments, which adversely affected PRC semiconductor suppliers and customers. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the fiscal quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022 revenue from sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately
57% and approximately 62% of total revenue, respectively. Less than 2% of our total revenue is denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenues and results of operations for the
fiscal quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022 was immaterial. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Cost of sales </i></p>

March 31, 2024. The Company has assessed the potential impact of the CAMT and does not expect the CAMT will have a material impact on the financial statements or results of operations. </p>

and other revenue was $1,004&nbsp;million and $1,141&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in license and other revenue primarily was due to marginal decrease in size and timing of new
licensing deals. License revenue may potentially be volatile across periods due to variability of large deals between fiscal years, which historically have had a large license revenue impact. Royalty revenue was approximately $1,675&nbsp;million and
approximately $1,562&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in royalty revenue was driven primarily by continued organic growth as a result of higher net ASP per chip and increased adoption
of our products by customers in their chips. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Revenue from external customers decreased by $194&nbsp;million during the fiscal years ended

related parties increased by $170&nbsp;million during the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 as compared to the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2022, primarily driven by a $196&nbsp;million increase in license and other revenue, which was
partially offset by a $26&nbsp;million decrease in royalty revenue as a result of economic and national security issues currently ongoing in the PRC. </p>

59% and approximately 54% of total revenue, respectively. Less than 2% of our total revenue is denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenues and results of operations for the
fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was immaterial. </p>

and other revenue was $1,141&nbsp;million and $714&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in license and other revenue primarily was due to an increase in licensing revenue from three
high-value license agreements and as we introduced new approaches to licensing certain of our products to provide more customers with more reasons and more ways to license. Royalty revenue was approximately $1,562&nbsp;million and approximately
$1,313&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in royalty revenue was driven primarily by continued organic growth as a result of higher net ASP per chip and increased adoption of our products

increase was due to general increases in salaries and related expenses and share-based compensation, increases in cloud engineering expenses, including cloud services, depreciation, and allocated facility overheads, partially offset by decreases in
employee related retention awards and increases in research and development tax credits. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>2022 compared to 2021 </i></p>

Other Revenue increased quarter over quarter driven by continued adoption of our technology product offerings, with the exception of the second quarter and fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The declines in those quarters were
predominantly due to marginal decrease in size and timing of new licensing deals. Our deals include term license recognized at the point in time upon delivery to the customer. License revenue may potentially be volatile across periods due to
variability of large deals between quarters, which historically have had a large license revenue impact. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Royalty Revenue </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Royalty revenue increased quarter over quarter driven by continued organic growth as a result of higher net ASP per chip and increased adoption
of our technology products by customers in their chips, with the exception of the third quarter and fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The declines in those two quarters were primarily as a result of economic and national
security issues currently ongoing in the PRC. The impact of these policies was more pronounced in the second half in comparison to the first half of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. We expect this volatility to continue in the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2024 and beyond. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Cost of sales and Gross profit </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our quarterly cost of sales trends do not vary directly with our license and other revenue and royalty revenue. As a result, we have not
experienced large fluctuations in the amount of our cost of sales from period to period. Our quarterly cost of sales expenses consist of employee-related expenses, project costs associated with professional services and the provision of support and
maintenance to customers, along with expenses related to license development services revenue, amortization of developed technology, and allocated overhead. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fluctuations in our gross profit for each of the periods presented were directly impacted by our total revenue for the same period. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Operating expense </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our operating expenses primarily consist of research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel related expenses
are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and associated benefits. Operating expenses also include cloud infrastructure costs and allocated overheads, amongst other items.
</p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Total operating expenses generally increased in each of the periods presented except for the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and June 30,
2022, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses, share based compensation, cloud infrastructure and other related costs to support our growth. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We experienced a decrease in total operating expenses during the first quarter ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter ended
March 31, 2022 primarily as a result of increase in bonus awards, acceleration of employee retention awards and one-time restructuring charges incurred in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2022. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also experienced an increase in total operating expenses in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the earlier quarters of
same fiscal year primarily as a result of new grants of share-based compensation, increase in bonus awards and increase in litigation provisions, incurred in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2023. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the first quarter ended June 30, 2023, we experienced a decrease in total operating expenses compared to the fourth quarter ended March 31,
2023 primarily as a result of decreases in employee retention awards, share-based compensation, and litigation provisions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We intend to
continue to make significant investments in research and development as we expand our existing technology product offerings. We also intend to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Liquidity and Capital Resources </b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our cash obligations as they become due, including requirements of our business operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, acquisitions and investments,
and other commitments. We have historically financed, and intend to continue to finance, our operations primarily through cash generated from our business operations, partially supported by government research grants and tax credits. For the fiscal
quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2023 and 2022, the government research grant and tax credits benefits recognized were approximately $34&nbsp;million and $24&nbsp;million, respectively. For the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the
government research grant and tax credits benefits recognized were approximately $83&nbsp;million, $84&nbsp;million and $94&nbsp;million, respectively. As of June&nbsp;30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,248&nbsp;million
and short-term investments of $801&nbsp;million. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be
adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the 12 months following the date of this prospectus and in the longer term. Our future capital requirements will depend on several factors, including our revenue growth, the timing and extent
of spending on R&amp;D efforts and other growth initiatives, the timing of new products and services introductions, market acceptance of our products, and overall economic conditions. We could be required, or could elect, to seek additional funding
through debt or equity financing; however, additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued
innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry.” </p>

operations. As a result of the restructuring plan, we recognized a liability of $26&nbsp;million, which is entirely related to estimated <font style="white-space:nowrap">one-time</font> employee termination benefit costs. The restructuring

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of
these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical and
anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Although
we believe that the estimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, actual results could differ materially (either positively or negatively, as applicable) from our estimates, which could have a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of management judgment and complexity. Accordingly, the following policies we believe are the most critical to aid in
fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Revenue Recognition </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our revenue is derived from contracts with customers. We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue upon the transfer of services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange
for those services or products. We apply the five-step framework under ASC 606 to recognize revenue as described in our revenue recognition policy included in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.
</p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606 and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct
performance obligations, the evaluation of the standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each performance obligation and the assessment of the contract combination criteria. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Determination of distinct performance obligations </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For our licensing arrangements, we grant customers the choice to acquire additional rights, goods, or services at contract inception (for
example, renewals of offerings, version extensions through term renewals, additional future products, or additional usage of term license). Therefore, judgment is required in determining whether products and services are considered distinct
performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. We utilize forward-looking information in identifying performance obligations for IP or their version extensions of architecture IP under development or future products and in
considering if implicit promises exist in certain long-term contracts. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation in the contract. Directly observable prices are generally
not available for our products, so we estimate the SSP for each performance obligation by maximizing the use of observable inputs. Some of our performance obligations, such as support, maintenance services, and training services, have observable
inputs that are used to determine the SSP of those distinct performance obligations. However, our licenses of products often have highly variable pricing as standalone sales are rare and pricing varies from one transaction to another. When offerings
with highly variable pricing lack substantial direct costs to estimate SSP based on a cost-plus margin approach, the transaction price is allocated using the residual approach on the basis that we have identified the SSP for other performance
obligations in the same contract. If two or more performance obligations have highly variable or uncertain pricing, we apply a combination of methods to estimate the SSPs, including utilizing list prices, contract prices, and effort estimates of
future IP. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Assessment of contract combination criteria </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In certain instances, we enter into multiple contracts with the same customer that are treated, for accounting purposes, as a single contract
if the contracts are entered into at, or near, the same time and are interrelated. Judgments are required in evaluating whether various contracts are interrelated, which includes considerations as to whether they were negotiated as a package with a
single commercial objective, where the amount of consideration on one contract is dependent on the performance of the other contract, or if some or all obligations in the contracts constitute a single performance obligation. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i></i><i>Estimates on Sales-Based Royalty Revenue Accruals</i><i> </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For certain license arrangements, sales-based royalties are collected on customers’ chips that incorporate our products. Royalties are set
either as a percentage of the licensee’s average selling price per chip or as a fixed amount per chip. Royalties are recognized on the licensee’s sales in the period in which they ship their
<font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-powered</font> chips to their end customers. Our estimates of royalty-based accruals take into consideration the macroeconomic effects of global events, such as COVID-19, geopolitical issues (such as trade bans
or wars), and natural disasters, any of which may interrupt supply chain activities as well as demand for shipments of technology products. These estimates also involve the use of historical data and judgment for several key attributes, including
industry estimates of expected shipments, the percentage of markets using our products, and average selling price. Generally, our estimates represent the then-current period’s shipments for which we expect our licensees to submit royalty
statements in the following quarter in accordance with our license agreements. Upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensees with the actual reporting of sales-based royalties that we previously estimated, we record a favorable or
unfavorable adjustment based on the difference, if any, between estimated and actual sales. Historically, actual amounts for sales-based royalties have been materially consistent with our estimates, and no significant adjustments have been required
for prior-period royalty estimates. However, we can provide no assurances that material adjustments will not be required in future periods. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Equity method investments represent strategic investments in unlisted development enterprises. For certain of these investments, we have
elected to apply the fair value option. Where applicable, the NAV practical expedient has been applied. Equity method investments measured at NAV were $109 million and $107 million as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equity method
investments measured at fair value as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 were $482 million and $524 million, respectively. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We elected the fair
value option for Arm China, Acetone Limited, and Ampere Computing LLC. We initially computed the fair value for our investments, consistent with the methodology and assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value,
with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist or based on inputs provided by the investee. The fair value computation is updated on a quarterly basis. The investments are classified within Level&nbsp;3 in the fair value hierarchy because
we estimate the fair value of the investments using (i)&nbsp;the market approach based on similar transactions, (ii)&nbsp;the market-calibration approach based on the guideline public company method and/or (iii)&nbsp;probability-weighted expected
return approach, and/or (iv) subject to the availability of sufficient information, the income approach based on the discounted cash flow method. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We consider numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of fair value for our investees. These factors include
forecasts, the financial condition of the investee and the prices paid for securities sold to third-party investors, if any, as well as the valuation of comparable companies. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Impairment of investments </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><font style="white-space:nowrap">Non-marketable</font> equity securities under the measurement alternative are subject to periodic impairment
analysis. The periodic impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee’s fair value. Qualitative factors considered include the investee’s financial condition and
business outlook, industry and sector performance, market for technology, operational and financing cash flow activities, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare a quantitative
assessment of the fair value of the equity investments using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenue and costs, and comparable market data of private and
public companies, among others. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized impairments of $8 million, $3 million and $21 million, respectively, on non-marketable equity securities. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Equity method investments not measured under the fair value option are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary
impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. We did not recognize any impairments on equity
method investments during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Ordinary Share Valuations </i></b></p>

market condition targets, and are contingent upon the occurrence of various events comprising a change in control, an initial public offering, or the passage of time. RSUs vest on the earliest to occur of (1) our initial public offering or six
months following our initial public offering (as applicable), (2) the acquisition of more than 50% of the voting power of our shares, or the sale of the Company or another change in control event, and (3) March 9, 2026. The vesting of certain RSUs
may be subject to market condition targets, and the remuneration committee has discretion to settle vested RSUs with shares or cash. If no change in control or initial public offering were to occur before December&nbsp;31, 2025, the remuneration
committee would have discretion to settle each RSU in cash, subject to achievement of certain market condition targets. The market condition targets are related to our valuation upon change in control, initial public offering, or passage of time.
The weighted average fair value of the RSUs was measured at each reporting date using the Monte Carlo simulation model. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Monte Carlo
simulation model simulates our equity value at an assumed listing exit event in order to determine the RSU vesting percentage. The model simulates the RSU vesting percentage over one million iterations, and the average of all iterations is the fair
value of an RSU. The model then discounts the future value of RSU at the assumed listing exit event date back to the valuation date based on the risk-free rate. The Monte Carlo simulation model incorporates various assumptions such as expected share
price volatility until a liquidity event, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and expected time to an initial public offering. </p>

liability-classified RSU awards for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. For awards under the 2019 AEP or the 2019 EIP that have not vested, due to a change in control or an initial public offering, these would be settled in

or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If our assessment concludes that it is
more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value of our reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the
quantitative goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Our goodwill impairment test considers the
income method and/or market method to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant judgments are required in assessing impairment of goodwill include the identification of reporting units, estimating future cash flows, determining
appropriate discount and growth rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value, whether an impairment exists and if so the amount of that impairment. </p>

included elsewhere in this prospectus for additional details. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Interest Rate Risk </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are exposed to interest rate risk arising on interest-bearing assets that we hold, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, and loans receivable. As of June 30, 2023, a hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximate $14&nbsp;million (positive or negative, as applicable) impact on our operating results in the consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Foreign Currency Exchange Risk </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are exposed to foreign exchange risk in respect of our revenues and expenses where our revenues and expenses are denominated in a currency

computing, on Arm. Together. For everyone. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Our Company </b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm is defining the future of computing. Semiconductor technology has become one of the world’s most critical resources, as it enables all
electronic devices today. At the heart of these devices is the CPU, and Arm is the industry leader of CPUs. We architect, develop, and license <font style="white-space:nowrap">high-performance,</font>
<font style="white-space:nowrap">low-cost,</font> and energy-efficient CPU products and related technology, on which many of the world’s leading semiconductor companies and OEMs rely to develop their products. Our energy-efficient CPUs have
enabled advanced computing in greater than 99% of the world’s smartphones, for the year ended December 31,&nbsp;2022, and more than 250&nbsp;billion chips, cumulatively, powering everything from the tiniest of sensors to the most powerful
supercomputers. Today, Arm CPUs run the vast majority of the world’s software, including the operating systems and applications for smartphones, tablets and personal computers, data centers and networking equipment, and vehicles, as well as the
embedded operating systems in devices such as smartwatches, thermostats, drones and industrial robotics. We estimate that approximately 70% of the world’s population uses <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> products, and the scale
of Arm’s reach continues to expand, with more than 30&nbsp;billion <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chips reported as shipped in the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 alone, representing an approximately 70% increase since
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Today, any company can make a modern computer chip through the unique combination of our
energy-efficient CPU IP and related technologies and our unmatched ecosystem of technology partners, and do it cost effectively due to our flexible business model. Each CPU product can be licensed to multiple companies, leading to economies of scale
that allow us to charge each licensee only a fraction of what it would cost them to develop internally, while minimizing their risk and <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">time-to-market.</font></font> With the
complexity of CPU design increasing exponentially, over the past decade no company has successfully designed a modern CPU from scratch. We have been innovating at the forefront of compute technology for decades and have established important
relationships with the companies driving the future of computing across multiple industries. More than 260 companies reported that they had shipped Arm-based chips in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, including the largest technology companies
globally (such as Amazon and Alphabet), major semiconductor chip vendors (such as AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, Qualcomm and Samsung), automotive industry incumbents, leading auto suppliers, IoT innovators, and more. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The exponential rise in smart devices in both consumer and enterprise markets has increased the demand for chips that provide more
computational capability while optimizing energy efficiency. Thirty years ago, the PC was the only computer with which most people would interact at home, work, or school. Then, mobile phones became computers in our pockets and digital TVs became
computers in our living rooms. Now, vehicles are effectively computers on wheels, and servers and networking equipment are the computers that connect devices and services together. Additionally, there are billions of tiny <font style="white-space:nowrap">low-cost</font> devices – from sensors to electric motor controllers – that are now functionally computers, as well. Each of these computers needs at least one CPU, and in many cases more than one. This trend has
driven the dramatic growth of <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chips over the past several years. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our creation of the
Arm CPU architecture, the world’s most widely used CPU architecture, has resulted in the proliferation and evolution of computers as people know them today, advancing a paradigm of increasing compute performance coupled with industry-leading
power efficiency. We enabled the mobile phone and smartphone revolution, and through our focus on energy efficiency and our history of continuous innovation, we have enabled new categories of “smart” consumer electronics. Today, we are
redefining what is possible in industries such as cloud computing, automotive, and IoT. Energy efficiency is not only important for business, but it is also a critical component in achieving sustainability for our planet. This makes Arm CPU
technology ideal for current and future computing applications as the demands for compute performance are growing exponentially while the need for low power remains critical. </p>

<center><div style="width:8.5in" align="left">
 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Every CPU has an ISA, which defines the software instructions that can be executed by the
CPU, essentially a common language for software developers to use. The ISA sets the foundation for a large library of compatible software which runs on those CPUs. As the Arm CPU is the most popular and pervasive CPU in history, the Arm ISA is also
the most popular and pervasive ISA in history. This means that Arm-based chips have a global community of software developers familiar with how to program the CPU. Chip designers utilizing the Arm CPU can add desired functionality <font style="white-space:nowrap">(Wi-Fi</font> connectivity, image processing, video processing, <i>etc</i>.) to create an SoC to meet the needs of any end market. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our primary product offerings are leading CPU products that address diverse performance, power, and cost requirements. Complementary products
such as GPUs, System IP, and compute platforms are also available and enable high-performance, efficient, reliable, system-level creation for a wide range of increasingly sophisticated devices and applications. Our development tools and robust
software ecosystem have further solidified our position as the world’s most widely adopted processor architecture and have created a virtuous cycle of adoption, which means that software developers write software for Arm-based devices because
it offers the biggest market for their products, and chip designers choose Arm processors because they have the broadest support of software applications. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This combination of pervasiveness and ease of portability has resulted in our CPU designs having the world’s richest software ecosystem,
built in partnership with the leading operating systems providers (including Google Android, Microsoft Windows and all major Linux distributions), software tools and game engine vendors (such as EA, Unity and Epic Games), and application developers.
We also support a flourishing ecosystem of third-party tool vendors for embedded software and a vibrant IoT ecosystem. Open-source software plays a vital role in the success of <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chips, and we are
committed to contributing to open-source software and tools to ensure our offerings are optimized for the latest technologies. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the
world moves increasingly towards AI- and ML-enabled computing, Arm will be central to this transition. Arm CPUs already run AI and ML workloads in billions of devices, including smartphones, cameras, digital TVs, cars and cloud data centers. The CPU
is vital in all AI systems, whether it is handling the AI workload entirely or in combination with a <font style="white-space:nowrap">co-processor,</font> such as a GPU or an NPU. In the emerging area of large language models, generative AI and
autonomous driving, there will be a heightened emphasis on the low power acceleration of these algorithms. In our latest ISA, CPUs, and GPUs, we have added new functionality and instructions to accelerate future AI and ML algorithms. We are working
with leading companies such as Alphabet, Cruise, Mercedes-Benz, Meta and NVIDIA to deploy Arm technology to run AI workloads. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm had
5,963 full-time employees across North America, Europe and Asia as of March&nbsp;31, 2023. We are an engineering-first company, with approximately 80% of our global employees, as of March&nbsp;31, 2023, focused on research, design, and technical
innovation, and we have global operations and research and development centers in the U.K, Europe, North America, India, and Asia-Pacific. Our headquarters are located in Cambridge, U.K. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, our total revenue was relatively flat at $2,679 million, as compared to $2,703 million in the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2022. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, as a percentage of total revenue our gross profit margin was 96% and operating income margin was 25%. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we generated net income from
continuing operations of $524 million (Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $657 million), compared to $676 million (Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $663 million) in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal-year ended March&nbsp;31, 2022, our total revenue grew by 33%, to $2,703&nbsp;million, from $2,027&nbsp;million in the fiscal

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>History </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Established in 1990, Arm
began as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple Computer, and VLSI Technology. We were publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market from 1998 until 2016, when we were taken private by SoftBank Group, our
controlling shareholder. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The original joint venture set out to develop a processor that was high performance, power efficient, easy to
program, and readily scalable – a goal that continues to define Arm today. One of the first <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> products was a predecessor of today’s tablets. As a battery-powered device, it required an
energy-efficient chip to maximize its battery life while providing the necessary compute capabilities. This product benefited from Arm’s clear focus on efficient CPU design. Our CPUs initially gained significant traction in mobile phones in the
<font style="white-space:nowrap">mid-1990s</font> because our energy-efficient processors provided an appropriate level of performance while consuming little power, which was critical for these smaller form factor devices. As the mobile phone market
continued to grow rapidly, more semiconductor companies entered the market. All these companies needed to source high-performance, energy-efficient processors to run their mobile phone software, and many of them licensed Arm CPU products. Over time,
mobile phones, and the chips they used, became more advanced and ultimately evolved into the smartphones that are prevalent today. The Arm CPU proved to be critical in enabling the smartphone revolution. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The mobile phone was one of the first consumer electronic devices to evolve into an intelligent, connected, digital device that needed a smart
processor to run a growing library of software. With the help of Arm technology, many more devices such as televisions, watches, washing machines, cameras, factory equipment, and others are undergoing the same revolution. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Strategic Evolution </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since
becoming a private company in 2016, we have made significant investments to further develop and market our products to build on our success in powering the world’s smartphones and other consumer electronic devices. We have focused in recent
years on making Arm the ubiquitous provider of compute technology in all market segments by expanding into new markets, including, but not limited to, cloud computing, networking, automotive, and IoT, most of which have strong secular tailwinds. Our
investments have resulted in a diversified business with more durable growth. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Key elements of our evolution included: </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Semiconductors are indispensable to everyday life. In today’s technology-driven world, semiconductors are the enablers of the devices and
infrastructure that facilitate virtually everything people do, such as making a phone call, sending an email, storing files in the cloud, streaming videos, or traveling by car, train, or plane. Almost all of the products and services people use
every day rely on semiconductors. Manufacturing, logistics, city infrastructure, and building management also increasingly build their processes and services around semiconductor-enabled devices. As consumers and enterprises continue to demand more
from their devices, the pervasiveness of high-performance and energy-efficient semiconductors will continue to expand. We believe there are several key trends driving the growth and evolution of the semiconductor industry. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Proliferation of Smart, Connected Devices Supporting an Increasingly Digital World </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The world is becoming increasingly digital with the proliferation of smart, connected devices, such as smartphones, wearables, PCs, tablets,
and other electronic devices. Even everyday products like washing machines, thermostats, and utility meters are becoming more advanced. According to Deloitte’s 2022 Connectivity and Mobile Trends Survey, the average U.S. household had 22
connected devices in 2022, doubling from 11 devices in 2019. The market trend to make nearly all products smart and connected is not just limited to consumer electronics, but is also driving a wave of innovation across a broad range of end markets
and use cases. For example, vehicles are effectively transforming into computers on wheels, factory floors are becoming increasingly automated with robotics, and retail shopping is evolving with the help of cashier-less checkout technology. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Increased Need for High-Performance, Power-Efficient Compute </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The massive expansion of data, advanced software applications, and AI are driving the need for
<font style="white-space:nowrap">high-performance</font> compute capabilities. To address increasingly complex workloads, a key approach has been to increase the speed of a CPU and expand the number of processor cores per chip. For example, core
count increased by approximately tenfold between 2010 and 2022 for many smartphone application processors and by more than 30 times over the same period for certain data center server chips. Moreover, the number of cores per “high end”
Arm-based chip has increased from 8 in 2016 to 192 in 2023. Solely running an existing chip faster may deliver more compute performance, but increasing performance in this way results in higher energy costs, and may cause thermal limits to be
exceeded. For example, individual servers are limited by their ability to dissipate heat energy, while whole data centers are limited by how much electricity is available to them. Mobile devices are limited by the energy stored in their batteries,
while their instantaneous power is limited by thermal constraints. Furthermore, the transition to electric vehicles is increasing pressure on automakers to consider the power consumption and thermal management of vehicle electronics. In addition,
enterprises are increasingly mindful of environmental sustainability, which is driving a need for more efficient alternatives to offset the continued growth in data centers and other compute deployments. According to McKinsey, the energy usage from
data centers is expected to increase two times by the end of 2030 relative to 2022 levels. Collectively, these considerations result in the need for innovation in chip design to address market demands for an optimal balance of performance,
efficiency, size, and cost across end markets. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Increasing Complexity and Cost of Designing Leading-Edge Solutions </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The resources required to develop leading-edge products are significant and continue to increase exponentially as manufacturing process nodes
shrink. According to IBS, IC design costs were approximately $249 million for a 7nm chip and approximately $725 million for a 2nm chip, representing approximately a three-times increase in design cost as compared to a 7nm chip. Design partners play
an increasingly valuable role in the chip design process by providing specialized capabilities and expertise that enable semiconductor suppliers to focus on their core product differentiation, while keeping pace with market innovation. Design
partners facilitate innovation and enhance customers’ competitive positioning by reducing the complexity, risk, and cost of a significant part of the development cycle. For example, to design a 2nm chip, IBS estimates that the software
development, verification, and IP qualification is 71% of the overall cost. In addition, design partners, like Arm, that can demonstrate a deep understanding of their customers’ workloads are better positioned to integrate themselves into their
customers’ workflows, further expanding their value proposition over time. </p> <p style="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt" align="center">

<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Growth of <font style="white-space:nowrap">In-House</font> Development and Custom Silicon Chips </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many OEMs today utilize <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">“off-the-shelf,”</font></font> or
“merchant,” semiconductors when building their product offerings. However, this approach can introduce compromises. For example, an OEM may use a chip that includes features that are irrelevant for its use case, at the expense of
performance and cost efficiency. Similarly, an OEM may need a chip that incorporates features not otherwise available from a merchant supplier. As a result, leading OEMs are increasingly looking to build custom chips in-house that deliver greater
performance and greater efficiency at an equal or better price for a particular use case. The successes of <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> products such as Amazon’s Graviton, deployed across Amazon data centers globally, have
demonstrated the opportunity to create a sustainable competitive advantage through this approach. For example, Amazon claims that Graviton delivers up to 40% better price performance over comparable x86-based systems. This trend of increasing use of
in-house developed solutions has significantly expanded the opportunity for Arm. </p>

IBISWorld, total internet traffic volume is expected to grow from 335 exabytes per month in 2022 to 580&nbsp;exabytes per month in 2025, representing a CAGR of 20%, thereby increasing the need to
deploy additional networking equipment. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market is growing as more wired and wireless infrastructure is deployed, as much of the data
consumed in the cloud is created at the edge and needs to be transmitted over networks to the data center for processing. We expect the networking equipment chip market to grow from approximately $17.2 billion in the calendar year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2022 to approximately $18.2 billion in the calendar year ending December&nbsp;31, 2025, representing a CAGR of 1.8% over that period. Our market share in the networking equipment market has increased from 18.8% as of December 31,
2020 to 25.5% as of December 31, 2022. Arm is posed to accelerate market-share gains resulting from the deployment of 5G networks as infrastructure scales from fewer large cell towers covering a wide area to a large number of small cells providing <font style="white-space:nowrap">high-speed</font> coverage, with a single architecture across both large and small cells to allow for flexible deployment of software and workloads. </p>

market includes the main server chips, DPUs, and SmartNICs used by CSPs to run their operations. These CSPs include Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Baidu, Inc., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Oracle Corporation. We expect the
cloud compute market to grow from approximately $17.9 billion in the calendar year ended December&nbsp;31, 2022 to approximately $28.4 billion in the calendar year ending December&nbsp;31, 2025, representing a CAGR of 16.6% over that period. The
increase in cloud computing has been driven by the rapid increase in data traffic generated by consumers and enterprises globally and by the migration of enterprise workloads to the cloud. As a result, IDC predicts spending on cloud infrastructure
to reach approximately 68% of total compute and storage infrastructure spend by 2027. As the volume of workloads continues to increase, CSPs are increasingly seeking custom processor solutions that can deliver improvements in performance per watt
and total cost of ownership. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chips have been gaining market share as CSPs, such as
Amazon and Alibaba, have started to deploy Arm products in their own <font style="white-space:nowrap">in-house</font> designed chips used in their data centers, and as other CSPs, such as Microsoft and Oracle, start to deploy chips designed by Arm
licensees, such as Ampere. As a result, we expect our market share of cloud compute to grow significantly faster than the overall cloud compute market. Our market share in the cloud compute market has grown from 7.2% as of December 31, 2020 to 10.1%

open and flexible business model provides access to high-quality CPU products for a wide range of potential customer types and end markets. We license our products to semiconductor companies, OEMs, and other organizations to design their chips. Our
customers license our products for a fee, which gives them access to our designs and enables them to create <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chips. Once a chip has been designed and manufactured with our products, we receive a
per-unit royalty on substantially all chips shipped. The royalty has typically been based on a percentage of the ASP of the chip or a fixed fee per unit, and it typically increases as more Arm products are included in the chip. Our business model
enables the widest range of customers to access Arm products through an agreement best suited to their particular business needs. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Arm Total Access

for multiple end markets. An Arm Total Access licensee pays an annual fee determined at execution of the agreement, and, in return, the licensee gains access to our portfolio of products, including new products that are introduced during the term of
the license. As of March 31, 2023, we had 18 Arm Total Access agreements with leading CSPs, microcontroller chip vendors, and networking chip vendors, including approximately half of our top 20 customers. Arm Total Access customers include Amazon
AWS, Infineon Technologies AG, Marvell Technology, Inc., Microsoft, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Realtek Semiconductor Corp, STMicroelectronics N.V. and others. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Arm Flexible Access </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm Flexible
Access is a low cost entry model for smaller companies and provides access to some of our most popular products for consumer electronics and embedded computing. An Arm Flexible Access licensee pays a nominal fee per year and, in return, gains access
to more than 80 components, including our <font style="white-space:nowrap">Cortex-M</font> and <font style="white-space:nowrap">Cortex-R</font> family of CPUs and many of the most widely deployed <font style="white-space:nowrap">Cortex-A</font> CPUs
and our System IP products. Although customers are free to experiment with products contained in the Arm Flexible Access package, they must pay a single use license fee for any products they include in a final chip design, and such license fee is
based on the specific products incorporated in that final chip design. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, we had 203 Arm Flexible Access agreements, including many smaller companies and <font style="white-space:nowrap">start-ups</font> who are still
developing their first <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-based</font> chip. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Both Arm Total Access and Arm Flexible Access agreements
provide our customers with access to a broad portfolio of Arm products, which changes the relationship between Arm and our customer from a sales engagement to a design partnership. Once the Arm Total Access or Arm Flexible Access is signed, our

more holistic license agreements, including Arm Total Access and Arm Flexible Access agreements. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Architecture Licenses </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A very small number of companies want to design customized Arm CPUs for their next-generation chips. For these companies, we can provide an
architecture license which allows the licensee to develop their own CPU design that is compliant with the Arm ISA. In addition to the architecture license fee, the licensee agrees to pay a royalty on every chip that contains the <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-compliant</font> design. As the creation of an optimized CPU is very costly and time consuming, architecture licensees often also license Arm CPU products to use either as a complementary processor alongside the
licensee’s <font style="white-space:nowrap">Arm-compliant</font> CPU design, or in other chips where the licensee’s own design is unsuitable. We expect the number of new licensees for this technology to diminish over time as the effort
required on their part to provide the customization often does not provide a reasonable return on investment. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Arm licenses can yield royalties for
many years </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regardless of the license model a customer uses, we receive a per-unit royalty fee on substantially every chip shipped.
Because each chip may ship for many years, and each Arm CPU can be reused in new products as new applications emerge, these licensing agreements help to ensure a long tail of recurring royalty revenues, which provide significant visibility into
future revenue streams. Arm is still collecting royalty revenues for products that were first developed and licensed in the early 1990s. For example, based on royalty revenue information provided to us by customers in quarterly royalty reports,
approximately 46% of our royalty revenue for the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 came from products released between 1990 to 2012. Our recurring royalties support Arm’s revenue growth into the future and provide enhanced performance
visibility and predictability, as new products and architectures are launched. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Competitive Strengths </b></p>

We estimate that, Arm’s engineers invested more than 10&nbsp;million hours in creating the base software and tools for chips containing Armv8 processors, and that the developers have then
spent another 1.5 billion hours creating their apps and software. We also estimate that Arm will be investing more than 30&nbsp;million hours creating the base software and tools for Armv9 processors, which will enable the next generation of apps

our established worldwide network of partners and customers affords us broad presence, which paired with an unparalleled software developer ecosystem gives us an advantage over other companies that license processor-related technology. Our products
are used in nearly all smartphones, a majority of tablets and digital TVs, and a significant proportion of all chips with embedded processors. In addition, we believe that our extensive ecosystem and the high barriers to entry into certain of our
end markets enhance our competitive position. The breadth of our ecosystem creates a virtuous cycle that benefits our customers and closely integrates us into their design cycle. We have deep relationships with our customers and ecosystem partners,
which provide unique visibility across the entire semiconductor industry. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We compete based on a variety of factors, including price,
performance, product quality, software availability, marketing and distribution capability, customer support, name recognition and financial strength. Further, given our reliance on our partners and customers, our competitive position is dependent
on our partners’ and customers’ competitive positions. In addition, our partners and customers do not license our products exclusively; rather, several of our partners and customers also design, develop, manufacture and market processors
based on <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-Arm</font> based architectures as well as develop their own Physical IP <font style="white-space:nowrap">in-house.</font> Our partners and customers compete with each other and with us in various
applications. The level of competition and the nature of the competitor generally varies based on the end market. For established markets where there is an incumbent architecture with a supporting ecosystem, it can be difficult for a new
architecture to displace existing architectures and, therefore, to gain market share. For example, we have made significant progress and have established a large market share in markets such as smartphones, consumer electronics and IoT. We face
competition primarily from other architectures like x86 and <font style="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V</font> in many of these markets. Furthermore, certain semiconductor companies, including some of our existing customers, have designed or are in the
process of designing their own architectures in markets such as smartphone application processors, other mobile chips, consumer electronics, IoT and embedded computing, networking equipment, automotive, and cloud compute. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The markets for our products are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. These changes result in frequent
product introductions, short product life cycles and increased product capabilities typically representing significant price and performance improvements. We face significant competition from established technologies such as the x86 architecture, as
well as from free, open-source technologies, including the <font style="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V</font> architecture. Many of our customers are also major supporters of the <font style="white-space:nowrap">RISC-V</font> architecture and related

taking a more disciplined approach on our costs and investment activities. To achieve this, we stopped work that was duplicative or no longer critical to our future success. This restructuring resulted in the termination of 436 general and
administrative positions across nine countries. Most of these terminations were in the U.K. and the U.S. The restructuring was completed by June 2022. </p>

carbon emissions. In September 2020, we committed to achieving net zero carbon by 2030, 20 years ahead of the 2050 target outlined in the United Nations’ Paris Climate Agreement. To achieve this, we are committed to taking a science-aligned
approach to cut absolute emissions by 50% (from a 2019 baseline) by 2030 and follow a 1.5° Celsius pathway. We have committed to a 42% reduction in supply-chain carbon, which is supported by our work with the Carbon Disclosure Project
(“CDP”) Supply Chain. Through the CDP Supply Chain, we have gathered data to reduce supply chain emissions, and the next step is to work with suppliers to reduce these emissions. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also recognize that our power- and energy-efficient products have a role to play in decarbonizing compute, and our longer-term objective is
to explore how we can continue to maximize these initiatives within our ecosystem. We recognize the importance of transparent reporting and produce comprehensive reports that demonstrate our commitment to the issues that are material to our business
and stakeholders, for example by reporting against the Global Reporting Initiative Index and to the CDP. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Closing the Digital Divide </i></b></p>

all of whom will continue to serve on our Board of Directors upon the completion of this offering. Mr.&nbsp;Son serves as the Chair of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that none of Ms.&nbsp;Dykstra,
Mr.&nbsp;Fadell, Ms.&nbsp;Schooler and Dr.&nbsp;Jacobs have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of director and that each of these directors is “independent” as
that term is defined under Nasdaq rules. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Six of our eight current directors were appointed in 2022 in anticipation of becoming a public
company. Prior to the appointment of these new directors, we undertook a fulsome review of the composition of our Board of Directors and the skills and qualifications necessary to lead our company going forward. Our Board of Directors considered
diversity of experience and expertise as well as gender, racial and ethnic diversity. We believe that the diversity of viewpoints and collective experience of our directors makes our Board of Directors well positioned to lead Arm into the future.

also granted Executive Awards with customized vesting schedules to certain of our executive officers. Annual Awards and <font style="white-space:nowrap">One-time</font> Launch Awards could be settled differently depending on whether vesting occurs
before or after our initial public offering. The Annual Award typically consists of a portion that is subject only to a time-based vesting schedule and a portion that is subject to a performance-based and time-based vesting schedule. The time-based
portion of the Annual Award vests on an annual basis over three years. The performance-based portion vests on an annual basis over three years, with each year’s vesting amount being within a range of 0% to 200% of the award value based on
whether our annual performance metrics are satisfied. The <font style="white-space:nowrap">One-time</font> Launch Awards vest on an annual basis over three years, with no performance-based vesting conditions. We have also granted Executive Awards
with terms that differ from those described above. Generally, these awards provide for all or a portion of the award to vest upon the earliest to occur of our initial public offering, a change in control event and a specified future date, subject to
continued employment through the applicable vesting date. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before our initial public offering, any portion of the Executive Awards that

right of our remuneration committee to satisfy all or part of any such vested portion in cash. As with the RSU awards, upon a change of control event, which generally includes the acquisition of more than 50% of the voting power of our shares or the
sale of all or substantially all of our assets, a pro rata portion of the unvested Executive Awards will vest. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Generally, unvested awards

employment or service as an executive director), except that if the cessation to be an eligible employee or executive director in question is due to <font style="white-space:nowrap">ill-health,</font> injury, disability or death, our remuneration
committee may vest all or a portion of that participant’s awards. The executive officer will not be treated as ceasing to be an eligible employee or executive director for these purposes upon leaving the employment of a member of our group if,
within the following seven days, he or she recommences employment with another member of our group. The awards will also lapse if our remuneration committee determines that part or all of any such unvested awards should lapse in accordance with any

pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which our securities are listed or as is otherwise required by applicable laws. At this time, we have not adopted a policy regarding the recovery of certain
incentive-based remuneration awarded to current and former executive officers in the event of an accounting restatement. In 2023, we intend to adopt a malus and clawback policy consistent with Rule <font style="white-space:nowrap">10D-1</font> of

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2019 AEP provides for the grant of RSUs and phantom shares. As of the date of this prospectus, our executive officers have only been
granted RSUs pursuant to the 2019 AEP. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Key Terms of RSUs Granted to our Executive Officers under the 2019 AEP </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">RSUs granted to our executive officers under the 2019 AEP generally vest on a linear scale on the earliest to occur of (1)&nbsp;180 days
following our initial public offering with a listing value between $32&nbsp;billion and $55&nbsp;billion and above (with none of the awards vesting when the value is $32&nbsp;billion or less and all awards vesting when the value is $55&nbsp;billion
or above), (2) the acquisition of more than 50% of the voting power of our shares, or sale of the Company or other change in control event with an implied value between $32&nbsp;billion and $55&nbsp;billion and above (with none of the awards vesting
when the value is $32&nbsp;billion or less and all awards vesting when the value is $55&nbsp;billion or above), and (3)&nbsp;March&nbsp;9, 2026 if the value of our fully diluted share capital on December&nbsp;31, 2025 is between $55&nbsp;billion and
$75&nbsp;billion and above (with none of the awards vesting when the value is $55&nbsp;billion or less and all awards vesting when the value is $75&nbsp;billion or above). </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If there is a change of control event following our initial public offering but before the vesting date which is 180 days after the initial
public offering, then the awards shall be capable of vesting only on the occurrence of such change of control event, and not the initial public offering, and for the purposes of calculating to what extent (if at all) a participant’s award
vests, our remuneration committee must determine the extent to which the relevant vesting hurdle is met or exceeded on both: (i)&nbsp;the initial public offering and (ii)&nbsp;the relevant change of control event, and subject to certain exceptions,
use whichever of the two measurements is more favorable to the participant. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other terms applicable to the RSUs awarded to our executive
officers under the 2019 AEP, including terms relating to termination of employment and forfeiture of the awards, awards being subject to any clawback polices we may adopt, adjustments in the event of changes to capitalization and similar events,
plan amendments and transferability of awards, are generally consistent with the terms of the RSUs granted under the 2022 RSU Plan, as described above. </p>

adopted by our shareholders on December&nbsp;8, 2019 and amended and restated on September&nbsp;6, 2022, and allows for the grant of awards to certain of our executive officers or other eligible employees designated by our remuneration committee in
its absolute discretion acting unanimously. Only one of our executive officers holds an award under the 2019 EIP. The material terms of the 2019 EIP are substantially similar to the terms of the 2019 AEP described above, except that
(1)&nbsp;participation is generally limited to our executive officers, (2)&nbsp;the aggregate number of shares over which our remuneration committee may grant awards under the 2019 EIP is 0.3% of the aggregate nominal amount of our fully diluted
equity share capital (less the aggregate of the nominal amount of shares allocated in respect of awards granted under the rules of the 2019&nbsp;EIP, excluding any shares allocated in respect of lapsed awards under the 2019 EIP), and
(3)&nbsp;vesting of the executive officer’s RSUs upon the earliest to occur of an initial public offering, sale of the Company or other change in control event and a specified future date is not subject to the value thresholds noted in the
discussion of the 2019 AEP. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>New Omnibus Incentive Plans </i></b></p>

ordinary shares outstanding on March&nbsp;31 of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (B) such smaller number of ordinary shares as determined by our Board of Directors or our remuneration committee. No more than 20,500,000 ordinary shares may
be issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan upon the exercise of incentive stock options. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If an award under the Omnibus Incentive Plan is
exchanged for or settled in cash, forfeited, canceled or expires without the issuance of our ordinary shares, any unused shares underlying the award will be deemed not to have been issued for purposes of determining the maximum number of ordinary
shares that may be issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Additionally, shares underlying awards issued by the Company in assumption of, or in substitution or exchange for, awards previously granted by a company acquired by the Company or any of
its affiliates or with which the Company or any of its affiliates combines will not be deemed not to have been issued for purposes of determining the maximum number of ordinary shares that may be issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. To the
extent not prohibited by applicable laws, any ordinary shares underlying an award that are surrendered or withheld in payment of the award’s exercise or purchase price, or in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations with respect to an award,
will be deemed not to have been issued for purposes of determining the maximum number of ordinary shares that may be issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, unless otherwise determined by the administrator. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Awards may be settled in ordinary shares or ADSs. References in this summary to ordinary shares include references to our ADSs. Ordinary

and award agreements at any time. Generally, if the administrator proposes any amendment, suspension or termination that would be to the material disadvantage of any grantees in respect of subsisting rights under the Omnibus Incentive Plan or the
relevant award agreement, then: (i) the administrator must invite each such disadvantaged grantee to indicate whether or not they approve the amendment, and (ii) such amendment shall only take effect if the majority (assessed by reference to the
size of affected awards) of the grantees who respond to an invitation consent to the amendment. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Change in Control </i></p>

participant, awards generally will only accelerate to the extent they are not substituted or assumed by the acquiring entity or if the awards are substituted or assumed by the acquiring entity and the participant’s service is terminated under
specified circumstances within 18 months following the change in control. In the event the awards are not assumed or substituted by the acquiring or surviving entity in a change in control, except as otherwise determined by the administrator or
provided in an award agreement, employment or similar agreement in the definitive change in control transaction agreement, time-based awards will become vested on a pro-rata basis as of the date of the change in control, and all or a portion of

event of a reorganization, amalgamation, dissolution, sale of assets or shares or other corporate transactions, the administrator may take a variety of actions with respect to outstanding awards, including canceling awards in exchange for cash or
other property, accelerating the vesting of awards, causing awards to be terminated or replaced with other rights or property or providing for the substitution or assumption of outstanding awards in a manner intended to preserve the intended

<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Administration </i></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For our
executive officers, the Annual Bonus Plan is administered by our remuneration committee. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Eligibility </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our (and our subsidiaries’) employees (which include our executive officers) are eligible to participate in the Annual Bonus Plan. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Start of Plan Period </i></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At
the start of each plan period (which runs from April&nbsp;1 of a year to March&nbsp;31 of the following year), our remuneration committee determines: (i)&nbsp;whether the Annual Bonus Plan will be operated in respect of that plan period,
(ii)&nbsp;which eligible executive officers may participate in the Annual Bonus Plan, (iii)&nbsp;each participant’s target percentage of the actual base salary which may be payable as the bonus award (the “Target Bonus Percentage”)
for such plan period; and (iv)&nbsp;the performance conditions for such plan period. With respect to the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, the target bonus opportunity of our executive officers was in the range from 100% to 125% of their base
salary levels. The maximum bonus award that can be earned is 200% of the target bonus award (based on the Target Bonus Percentage of the participant’s salary) plus any individual performance multiplier. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Performance Conditions </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our remuneration committee sets performance conditions for each plan period for the whole Company, one or more divisions or business units of
the Arm group (or any subdivision thereof), and/or individual participants, as appropriate, and may in its sole discretion amend or waive the performance conditions in whole or in part (a)&nbsp;in accordance with the terms specified in the
performance conditions, or (b)&nbsp;if events happen which cause our remuneration committee to consider that (i)&nbsp;the amended performance conditions would be a fairer measure of performance and would be no more difficult to satisfy than the
existing performance conditions, or (ii)&nbsp;the existing performance conditions should be waived in whole or in part. Our remuneration committee may withhold, reduce or cancel all or any part of the bonus award for any participant in the event
that our remuneration committee considers that such participant’s performance or conduct during the plan period warrants such action. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, the performance conditions were based on the revenue and profit (EBITDA) of our
group. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, a participant’s actual bonus percentage was affected by
(i)&nbsp;the Company performance multiplier (the maximum of which was 100%), and (ii)&nbsp;such participant’s </p>

individual performance multiplier, based on such participant’s overall ratings assigned in his or her 2023 annual review. The maximum bonus award a participant could receive for the fiscal
year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 was 125% of the Target Bonus Percentage of his or her actual base salary (100% attributed to our performance, multiplied by 1.25 for an “Exceptional” rating). </p>

making a <font style="white-space:nowrap">pro-rata</font> adjustment to such entitlement based on the portion of such plan period in which such participant participated in the Annual Bonus Plan. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our remuneration committee, in its sole discretion and at any time within a plan period, may evaluate performance conditions and make changes
to a participant’s defined targets. In such case, such participant’s bonus award shall be calculated based on our remuneration committee’s evaluation, in its sole discretion, of what such participant’s full-year bonus award
entitlement would have been under the original performance conditions and what such participant’s full-year bonus award entitlement would be under the new performance conditions. Following this, our remuneration committee shall make an
adjustment to such bonus award based on each of the two entitlements. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Termination of Employment </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Generally, a participant must be continuously employed by a member of our group through the end of the applicable plan period in order to
receive a bonus award for such plan period. If a participant ceases to be an eligible executive officer prior to the end of such plan period for any reason, such participant shall immediately forfeit upon termination any and all entitlement to any
portion of the bonus award for such plan period. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Change in Control </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the event of a change of control event during a plan period, the plan period will end and each participant will receive a bonus award
payment, payable as soon as administratively practicable following such change of control event, calculated by determining what such participant’s full-year bonus award entitlement would have been based on deemed maximum achievement of the
applicable performance conditions through the date of the consummation of such change of control event and then making a <font style="white-space:nowrap">pro-rata</font> adjustment to such entitlement based on the portion of such plan period
occurring before the date on which such change of control event is consummated. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Plan Amendment and Termination </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to applicable law, our Board of Directors or Executive Committee (or another duly authorized committee) may (i)&nbsp;delete, alter or
add to any of the provisions of the Annual Bonus Plan in any respect at any time unilaterally and without the consent of any participant, or (ii)&nbsp;terminate the Annual Bonus Plan at any time. If the Annual Bonus Plan is terminated during a plan
period, such termination will not affect the operation of the Annual Bonus Plan for the rest of such plan period and bonus awards may be determined and paid pursuant to the rules of the Annual Bonus Plan. </p>

to the completion of this offering, we expect to adopt a related party transaction policy. Our related party transaction policy will set forth our procedures for the identification, review, consideration and approval or ratification of related party
transactions. The policy will become effective in connection with this offering. For purposes of our policy only, a related party transaction is any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or
relationships (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) between us or any of our parent or subsidiaries and any related party. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us as an employee or director are not covered
by this policy. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to the provisions of the Shareholder Governance Agreement applicable to transactions with SoftBank Group and its
affiliates described below, under the policy, if a transaction has been identified as a related party transaction, including any transaction that was not a related party transaction when originally consummated or any transaction that was not
initially identified as a related party transaction prior to consummation, the related party transaction must be approved or ratified by the audit committee of our Board of Directors. In reviewing any such transaction, our audit committee will
consider, among other things, the material facts, the interests, direct and indirect, of the related parties, the benefits to us of the transaction and whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to or from, as the
case may be, an unrelated third party or to or from employees generally. With respect to transactions with SoftBank Group and its affiliates, for so long as the corresponding provisions in the Shareholder Governance Agreement remain in effect, the
audit committee will not be required to approve (i) transactions or arrangements existing as of the date of our listing and disclosed in this prospectus; provided that extensions and material amendments thereof will require approval to the same
extent as other related party transactions; (ii) ordinary course transactions upon terms generally available to third parties unless the applicable transaction or series of related transactions has a value over $20 million, in which case our Board
of Directors must review and approve or ratify the transaction; and (iii) transactions that the audit committee determines are at arm’s length, in which case our Board of Directors must review and approve the transaction. See
“—Transactions with SoftBank Group—Shareholder Governance Agreement—Rights Related to Related Party Transactions.” Under the policy, we will collect information that we deem reasonably necessary from each director, executive
officer and, to the extent feasible, significant shareholder to enable us to identify any existing or potential related party transactions and to effectuate the terms of the policy. In addition, under our Code of Conduct, our employees and directors
have an affirmative responsibility to disclose any material transaction or relationship that may give rise to a conflict of interest. </p>

incorporated as a private limited company with the legal name Arm Holdings Limited under the laws of England and Wales on April&nbsp;9, 2018, with the company number 11299879. Arm Holdings Limited
<font style="white-space:nowrap">re-registered</font> as a public limited company on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;2023 and changed its name to Arm Holdings plc. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arm Limited was incorporated as a private limited company with the legal name Widelogic Limited under the laws of England and Wales on
November&nbsp;12, 1990 with the company number 02557590. On December&nbsp;3, 1990, Widelogic Limited changed its company name to Advanced RISC Machines Limited, and, on May&nbsp;21, 1998, it changed its company name to Arm Limited, which was a
wholly owned subsidiary of Arm Holdings plc with the company number 02548782. Our business was initially operated through Arm Holdings plc with the company number 02548782, which was previously an independent publicly traded corporation until its
acquisition in September 2016 by SoftBank Group. On March&nbsp;19, 2018, as a part of a reorganization, Arm Holdings plc with the company number 02548782 <font style="white-space:nowrap">re-registered</font> as a private limited company and was
renamed SVF HoldCo (UK) Limited, which became a subsidiary of SoftBank Vision Fund, which retained an approximate 25% interest in our company with the remainder beneficially held by SoftBank Group. In August 2023, a subsidiary of SoftBank Group
acquired substantially all of SoftBank Vision Fund’s interest in Arm Limited at a purchase price of approximately $16.1 billion, with the associated payments to be made in installments over a two-year period. The purchase price was established
by reference to the terms of a prior contractual arrangement between the parties. Accordingly, prior to this offering, SoftBank Group beneficially owns substantially all of our outstanding shares. Our registered office is 110 Fulbourn Road,
Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB1 9NJ, U.K. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the terms of our corporate reorganization: (i)&nbsp;each ordinary share in the
capital of Arm Holdings Limited was transferred, by way of a dividend in specie, by Arm Limited to each of the shareholders of Arm Limited in an approximate proportion to the shareholding that such shareholders held in Arm Limited; (ii)&nbsp;the
shareholders of Arm Limited exchanged each of the ordinary shares held by them in Arm Limited for newly issued ordinary shares of Arm Holdings Limited of the same class and in approximately the same proportions as their previous shareholding in Arm
Limited, and as a result, Arm Holdings Limited became the sole shareholder of Arm Limited; and (iii)&nbsp;Arm Holdings <font style="white-space:nowrap">Limited&nbsp;re-registered&nbsp;as</font> a public limited company and changed its name to Arm
Holdings plc. See “Corporate Reorganization” for more information. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Share Capital </b></p>

shares of £0.001 per share were outstanding as of such date and each issued share was (and remains) fully paid. During the period from June&nbsp;30, 2023 to

part of our corporate reorganization, the shareholders of Arm Limited exchanged each of the ordinary shares held by them in Arm Limited for newly issued ordinary shares of Arm Holdings Limited of the same class and in approximately the same
proportions as their previous shareholding in Arm Limited, and as a result, Arm Holdings Limited became the sole shareholder of Arm Limited. See “Corporate Reorganization” for more information. </p>

company’s articles of association, or shareholders at a general meeting representing at least 75% of our ordinary shares present (in person or by proxy) and voting at that general meeting, to disapply these preemptive rights. Such a
disapplication of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years from the date of adoption of the Articles, if the disapplication is contained in the Articles, or from the date of the shareholder resolution, if the disapplication
is by shareholder resolution. In either case, this disapplication would need to be renewed by the Company’s shareholders upon its expiration (i.e., at least every five years). On
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2023, our shareholders approved the disapplication of preemptive rights for a period ending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, which disapplication will need to be renewed upon expiration (i.e., at least every five years) to remain effective, but may be

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Application of the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Takeover Code applies to all offers for companies which have their registered office in the U.K., the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man if
any of their equity share capital or other transferable securities carrying voting rights are admitted to trading on a U.K. regulated market or a U.K. multilateral trading facility or on any stock exchange in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.
</p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Takeover Code also applies to all offers for public companies which have their registered office in the U.K., the Channel Islands or
the Isle of Man if they are considered by the Takeover Panel to have their place of central management and control in the U.K., the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. This is known as the “residency test.” In determining whether the
residency test is satisfied, the Takeover Panel has regard primarily to whether a majority of a company’s directors are resident in these jurisdictions. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although our registered office is in the U.K., the Takeover Code does not currently apply to the us because our shares are not admitted to
trading on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility in the U.K. or any stock exchange in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, and the Takeover Panel has confirmed to us that, on the basis of the current residency of our directors as at
the date of this prospectus, we will not have our place of central management and control in the U.K., the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, our shareholders are not currently entitled to the benefit of certain takeover offer protections provided under the Takeover
Code, including the rules regarding mandatory takeover bids and, therefore, holders of ADSs will not benefit from these protections. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
the event that this changes, or if the interpretation and application of the Takeover Code by the Takeover Panel changes (including changes to the way in which the Takeover Panel assesses the application of the Takeover Code to English companies
whose shares are listed outside of the U.K., the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man), the Takeover Code may apply to us in the future. </p> <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</p>

laws of England and Wales, a public limited company may purchase its own shares out of the distributable profits of the company or the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purpose of financing the purchase, subject to complying with
procedural requirements under the Companies Act (including that the purchase be approved by the company’s shareholders) and provided that the Articles do not restrict the company’s ability to purchase its own shares. Our Articles will not
prohibit us from purchasing our own shares. Therefore, subject to the Companies Act and without prejudice to any relevant special rights attached to any class of shares, the Company may purchase any of its own shares of any class in any way and at
any price (whether at par or above or below par). A limited company may not purchase its own shares if, as a result of the purchase, there would no longer be any issued shares of the company other than redeemable shares or shares held as treasury
shares. Shares must be fully paid in order to be repurchased. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any such purchase will be either a “market purchase” or an
“off market purchase,” each as defined in the Companies Act. A “market purchase” is a purchase made on a “recognized investment exchange” (other than an overseas exchange) as defined in the U.K. Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000, as amended (the “FSMA”). An “off market purchase” is a purchase that is not made on a “recognized investment exchange.” Both “market purchases” and “off market purchases” require
prior shareholder approval by way of an ordinary resolution. In the case of an “off market purchase,” a company’s shareholders, other than the shareholders from whom the company is purchasing shares, must approve the terms of the
contract to purchase shares and in the case of a “market purchase,” the shareholders must approve the maximum number of shares that can be purchased and the maximum and minimum prices to be paid by the company. Both resolutions authorizing
“market purchases” and <font style="white-space:nowrap">“off-market</font> purchases” must specify a date, not later than five years after the passing of the resolution, on which the authority to purchase is to expire. </p>

stamp duty reserve tax) at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration payable by the company (rounded up to the next £5.00), and such stamp duty (or stamp duty reserve tax) will be paid by the company. The charge to stamp
duty reserve tax will be cancelled or, if already paid, repaid (generally with interest), where a transfer instrument for stamp duty purposes has been duly stamped within six years of the charge arising (either by paying the stamp duty or by
claiming an appropriate relief) or if the instrument is otherwise exempt from stamp duty. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Nasdaq Global Select Market is an
“overseas exchange” for the purposes of the Companies Act and accordingly does not fall within the definition of a “recognized investment exchange” for the purposes of the FSMA, as modified by the Companies Act, and any purchase
made by us would need to comply with the procedural requirements under the Companies Act that regulate “off market purchases.” </p>

the Companies Act, before a company can lawfully make a distribution or dividend, it must ensure that it has sufficient distributable reserves (on a non-consolidated basis). The basic rule is that a company’s profits available for the purpose
of making a distribution are its accumulated, realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of
capital duly made. The requirement to have sufficient distributable reserves before a distribution or dividend can be paid applies to us and to each of our subsidiaries that has been incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. </p>

agreed to act as the depositary for the ADSs. Citibank’s depositary offices are located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013. ADSs represent ownership interests in securities that are on deposit with the depositary. ADSs may be
represented by certificates that are commonly known as American Depositary Receipts. The depositary typically appoints a custodian to safe keep the securities on deposit. In this case, the custodian is Citibank, N.A., London Branch, located at
Citigroup Centre, Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5LB, United Kingdom. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have appointed Citibank as depositary pursuant to a

SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are providing you with a summary description of the material terms of the ADSs and of your material
rights as an owner of ADSs. Please remember that summaries by their nature lack the precision of the information summarized and that the rights and obligations of an owner of ADSs will be determined by reference to the terms of the deposit agreement
and not by this summary. We urge you to review the deposit agreement in its entirety. The portions of this summary description that are italicized describe matters that may be relevant to the ownership of ADSs but that may not be contained in the
deposit agreement. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each ADS represents the right to receive, and to exercise the beneficial ownership interests in, one ordinary share
that is on deposit with the depositary and/or custodian. An ADS also represents the right to receive, and to exercise the beneficial interests in, any other property received by the depositary or the custodian on behalf of the owner of the ADS but
that has not been distributed to the owners of ADSs because of legal restrictions or practical considerations. We and the depositary may agree to change the
<font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">ADS-to-ordinary</font></font> share ratio by amending the deposit agreement. This amendment may give rise to, or change, the depositary fees payable by ADS owners. The custodian, the
depositary and their respective nominees will hold all deposited property for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of ADSs. The deposited property does not constitute the proprietary assets of the depositary, the custodian or their
nominees. Beneficial ownership in the deposited property will, under the terms of the deposit agreement, be vested in the beneficial owners of the ADSs. The depositary, the custodian and their respective nominees will be the record holders of the
deposited property represented by the ADSs for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the corresponding ADSs. A beneficial owner of ADSs may or may not be the holder of ADSs. Beneficial owners of ADSs will be able to receive, and to

have direct shareholder rights. The depositary will hold on your behalf the shareholder rights attached to the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs. As an owner of ADSs you will be able to exercise the shareholders rights for the ordinary shares
represented by your ADSs through the depositary only to the extent contemplated in the deposit agreement. To exercise any shareholder rights not contemplated in the deposit agreement you will, as an ADS owner, need to arrange for the cancellation of
your ADSs and become a direct shareholder. The manner in which you own the ADSs (e.g., in a brokerage account vs. as registered holder, or as holder of certificated vs. uncertificated ADSs) may affect your rights and obligations, and the manner in
which, and the extent to which, the depositary’s services are made available to you. </i></p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As an owner of ADSs, you may hold your ADSs
either by means of an ADR registered in your name, through a brokerage or safekeeping account, or through an account established by the depositary in your name reflecting the registration of uncertificated ADSs directly on the books of the
depositary (commonly referred to as the direct registration system or DRS). The direct registration system reflects the uncertificated (book-entry) registration of ownership of ADSs by the depositary. Under the direct registration system, ownership
of ADSs is evidenced by periodic statements issued by the depositary to the holders of the ADSs. The direct registration system includes automated transfers between the depositary and DTC, the central book-entry clearing and settlement system for
equity securities in the U.S. If you decide to hold your ADSs through your brokerage or safekeeping account, you must rely on the procedures of your broker or bank to assert your rights as an ADS owner. Banks and brokers typically hold securities
such as the ADSs through clearing and settlement systems such as DTC. The procedures of such clearing and settlement systems may limit your ability to exercise your rights as an owner of ADSs. Please consult with your broker or bank if you have any
questions concerning these limitations and procedures. All ADSs held through DTC will be registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. This summary description assumes you have opted to own the ADSs directly by means of an ADS registered in your name
and, as such, we will refer to you as the “holder.” When we refer to “you,” we assume the reader owns ADSs and will own ADSs at the relevant time. </p>

law, vest in the depositary or the custodian the record ownership in the applicable ordinary shares with the beneficial ownership rights and interests in such ordinary shares being at all times vested with the beneficial owners of the ADSs
representing the ordinary shares. The depositary or the custodian shall at all times be entitled to exercise the beneficial ownership rights in all deposited property, in each case only on behalf of the holders and beneficial owners of the ADSs
representing the deposited property. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Dividends and Other Distributions </b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a holder of ADSs, you generally have the right to receive the distributions we make on the securities deposited with the custodian. Your
receipt of these distributions may be limited, however, by practical considerations and legal limitations. Holders of ADSs will receive such distributions under the terms of the deposit agreement in proportion to the number of ADSs held as of the
specified record date, after deduction of the applicable fees, taxes and expenses. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Distributions of Cash </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Whenever we make a cash distribution for the securities on deposit with the custodian, we will deposit the funds with the custodian. Upon
receipt of confirmation of the deposit of the requisite funds, the depositary will arrange for the funds received in a currency other than U.S. dollars to be converted into U.S. dollars and for the distribution of the U.S. dollars to the holders,
subject to the laws and regulations of England and Wales. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The conversion into U.S. dollars will take place only if practicable and if the
U.S. dollars are transferable to the U.S. The depositary will apply the same method for distributing the proceeds of the sale of any property (such as undistributed rights) held by the custodian in respect of securities on deposit. </p>

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our ordinary shares or ADSs. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Future sales of ordinary shares and ADSs in the public market after this offering, and the availability of ordinary shares and ADSs for future
sale, could adversely affect the market price of the ordinary shares and ADSs prevailing from time to time. As described below, a significant number of currently outstanding ordinary shares will not be available for sale shortly after this offering
due to contractual restrictions on transfers. There may be sales of substantial amounts of our ADSs in the public market after such restrictions lapse. Sales of substantial amounts of our ADSs, or the perception that these sales could occur, could
adversely affect prevailing market prices for our ADSs and could impair our ability to raise equity capital in the future. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on the
number of ordinary shares outstanding as of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2023, we will have outstanding an aggregate of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ordinary shares, including ordinary shares represented by ADSs, following this offering. All of the ADSs to be sold in this
offering, including any ADSs sold upon exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ADSs, will be freely tradable in the U.S. public market without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless the ADSs are
held by any of our “affiliates” as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;144 of the Securities Act, subject, in each case, to the terms of the <font style="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</font> agreements referred to below or the resale
restrictions provided for in Rule&nbsp;144 of the Securities Act, as applicable. The number of ADSs available for sale immediately after this offering will be the number sold in this offering less any ADSs held by our directors, officers and the
selling shareholder that are subject to <font style="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</font> agreements through 180 days after the date of this prospectus. </p>

representatives of the underwriters, we and they will not, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus,&nbsp;offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any
option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any ordinary shares or ADSs or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our
ordinary shares or ADSs. Any two of the four representatives of the underwriters may release the securities subject to any of the <font style="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</font> agreements with the underwriters described above, in whole or in part
at any time. The exceptions to the lock-up agreement signed by the selling shareholder will include, among other things, any action necessary or appropriate for the purposes of pledging, charging or granting any lien, mortgage or other security
interest with respect to the ordinary shares for the benefit of lenders or finance counterparties (as well as any security agent, securities intermediary and/or custodian) (together, the “Pledgees”) in connection with a bona fide loan

of the lock-up. See “Underwriting” for detailed descriptions of the lock-up agreements, including the exclusions and exceptions thereto. </p>

may not calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, we expect that distributions generally will be reported to U.S. Holders as dividends. Subject to applicable limitations, including conditions relating to holding
period and the absence of certain risk reduction transactions, dividends paid to certain <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-corporate</font> U.S. Holders may be taxable at preferential rates applicable to “qualified dividend income”

treaty with the U.S. which the Secretary of Treasury of the United States determines is satisfactory for purposes of these rules and which includes an exchange of information provision (which includes the Treaty) or (ii)&nbsp;with respect to any
dividend it pays on ordinary shares or ADSs which are readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S. Our ADSs (but not ordinary shares) will be listed on Nasdaq, which is a qualified exchange for these purposes. Consequently, if
our ADSs remain listed on Nasdaq and are regularly traded, we expect to be a qualified foreign corporation for purposes of dividends paid by us constituting qualified dividend income. However, the qualified dividend income treatment will not apply
if we are treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Holder for our taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year. The amount of the dividend will be treated as foreign-source dividend income to U.S. Holders and will not be eligible
for the dividends-received deduction generally available to U.S. corporations under the Code. Dividends will generally be included in a U.S. Holder’s income on the date of the U.S. Holder’s actual or constructive receipt of the dividend.
The amount of any dividend income paid in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of actual or constructive receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted

cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer that has made a special election (which must be applied consistently from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS), the U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of
the amount realized in a <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</font> dollar currency by translating the amount received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the sale. If the U.S. Holder is an accrual basis taxpayer that is not

certain gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and certain rents and royalties, and cash and cash-equivalents are generally passive assets for these purposes. In addition, for purposes of the above calculations, a <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</font> corporation that directly or indirectly owns at least 25% by value of the shares of another corporation is treated as holding and receiving directly its proportionate share of assets and income,
respectively, of such other corporation. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares or ADSs, the U.S. Holder may be subject to adverse tax consequences regardless of whether we continue to qualify as a

solely resident in the U.K. for tax purposes and will therefore be subject to the U.K. tax regime and not the U.S. tax regime except as set out above under “U.S. Federal Income Taxation.” </p>

holding the beneficial interest in the underlying shares and therefore these paragraphs assume that a holder of ADSs and/or ADRs is the beneficial owner of the underlying ordinary shares and any dividends paid in respect of the underlying ordinary
shares (where the dividends are regarded for U.K. purposes as that person’s own income) for U.K. direct tax purposes. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>THESE PARAGRAPHS ARE A

THEIR OWN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES FROM THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS. IN PARTICULAR, <font style="white-space:nowrap">NON-U.K.</font> RESIDENT OR DOMICILED PERSONS ARE ADVISED TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ANY RELEVANT DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENTS.

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A holder of ADSs and/or ADRs which is not resident for tax purposes in the U.K. should not normally be liable to U.K. capital gains tax or
corporation tax on chargeable gains on a disposal (or deemed disposal) of ADSs and/or ADRs unless the person is carrying on (whether solely or in partnership) a trade, profession or vocation in the U.K. through a branch or agency (or, in the case of
a corporate holder of ADSs and/or ADRs, through a permanent establishment) to which the ADSs and/or ADRs are attributable. However, an individual holder of ADSs and/or ADRs who has ceased to be resident for tax purposes in the U.K. for a period of
less than five&nbsp;years and who disposes of ADSs and/or ADRs during that period may be liable on his or her return to the U.K. to U.K. tax on any capital gain realized (subject to any available exemption or relief). </p>

certain provisions relating to trusts or settlements, an ADS and/or ADR held by an individual shareholder who is domiciled in the U.S. for the purposes of the convention between the U.S. and the U.K. relating to estate and gift taxes (the
“Convention”) and who is neither domiciled in the U.K. nor (where certain conditions are met) a U.K. national (as defined in the Convention), will generally not be subject to U.K. inheritance tax on the individual’s death (whether
held on the date of death or gifted during the individual’s lifetime) except where the ADS and/or ADR is part of the business property of a U.K. permanent establishment of the individual or pertains to a U.K. fixed base of an individual who
performs independent personal services. In a case where an ADS and/or ADR is subject both to U.K. inheritance tax and to U.S. federal gift or estate tax, the Convention generally provides for inheritance tax paid in the U.K. to be credited against
federal gift or estate tax payable in the U.S., or for federal gift or estate tax paid in the U.S. to be credited against any inheritance tax payable in the U.K., based on priority rules set forth in the Convention. </p>

connected with clearance services and depositary receipt systems. Such persons may not be liable to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT or may be so liable at a higher rate. Furthermore, such persons may, although not primarily liable for the tax, be required

shares are held in certificated form) or SDRT (if the ordinary shares are held in uncertificated form), in either case at the rate of 0.5% (or potentially 1.5% in certain circumstances) of the amount or value of the consideration paid for the
ordinary shares (for example in respect of transfer of ordinary shares or a redeposit of ordinary shares into the ADR program). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further,
SDRT will generally be payable on an unconditional agreement to transfer ordinary shares in certificated form at 0.5% (or potentially 1.5% in certain circumstances) of the amount or value of the consideration for the transfer, but is repayable if,
within six years of the date of the agreement, an instrument transferring the ordinary shares is executed. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Therefore, you are strongly

“ARM”. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, which involves making bids
for, purchasing and selling ADSs in the open market for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the ADSs while this offering is in progress. These stabilizing transactions may include making short sales of ADSs, which
involves the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of ADSs than they are required to purchase in this offering, and purchasing ADSs on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales may be “covered” shorts,
which are short positions in an amount not greater than the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ADSs referred to above, or may be “naked” shorts, which are short positions in excess of that amount. The underwriters may close
out any covered short position either by exercising their option to purchase additional ADSs, in whole or in part, or by purchasing ADSs in the open market. In making this determination, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price
of ADSs available for purchase in the open market compared to the price at which the underwriters may purchase ADSs through the option to purchase additional ADSs. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned
that there may be downward pressure on the price of the ADSs in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. To the extent that the underwriters create a naked short position, they will purchase ADSs in the
open market to cover the position. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation&nbsp;M of the Securities Act, they may
also engage in other activities that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the ADSs, including the imposition of penalty bids. This means that if the representatives of the underwriters purchase ADSs in the open market in stabilizing
transactions or to cover short sales, the representatives can require the underwriters that sold those ADSs as part of this offering to repay the underwriting discount received by them. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These activities may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the ADSs or preventing or retarding a decline in the market
price of the ADSs and, as a result, the price of the ADSs may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If the underwriters commence these activities, they may discontinue them at any time. The underwriters may carry
out these transactions on Nasdaq, in the <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">over-the-counter</font></font> market or otherwise. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our ADSs. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiations
among us, the selling shareholder and the representatives of the underwriters. In determining the initial public offering price, we, the selling shareholder and the representatives of the underwriters expect to consider a number of factors,

and Morrison&nbsp;&amp; Foerster LLP that there is currently no treaty between (i)&nbsp;the U.S. and (ii)&nbsp;England and Wales providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters
(although the U.S. and the U.K. are both parties to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards) and that a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any general or state court in the U.S. based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be automatically enforceable in England and Wales. We have also been advised by Morrison&nbsp;&amp; Foerster (UK) LLP and Morrison&nbsp;&amp; Foerster LLP that
any final and conclusive monetary judgment for a definite sum obtained against us in the U.S. courts would be treated by the courts of England and Wales as a cause of action in itself and sued upon as a debt at common law so that no retrial of the
issues would be necessary, provided that certain preconditions are met, including, but not limited to, that the relevant U.S. court had jurisdiction over the original proceeding according to English conflicts of laws principles and that the U.S.
judgment was final and not procured by fraud. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Whether the preconditions are met in respect of a judgment based upon the civil liability
provisions of the United States securities laws, including whether the award of monetary damages under such laws would constitute a penalty, is an issue for the court making such decision. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been
obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally
available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the English court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is
or becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any <font style="white-space:nowrap">set-off</font> or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Also note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the
judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings. It should also be noted that in the
courts of England and Wales the usual rule is that the losing party is ordered to pay the legal costs of the litigation that were incurred by the successful party. These costs are assessed by the courts of England and Wales at the conclusion of the
litigation. </p>

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have filed with the SEC a registration statement (including amendments and exhibits to the registration statement) on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">F-1</font> under the Securities Act. A related registration statement on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">F-6</font> will be filed with the SEC to register the ADSs. This prospectus, which forms a part of the
registration statement on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">F-1,</font> does not contain all of the information included in the registration statement on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">F-1</font> and the exhibits and schedules to the
registration statement on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">F-1.</font> Certain information is omitted and you should refer to the registration statement on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">F-1</font> and its exhibits and schedules for that
information. If a document has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">F-1,</font> we refer you to the copy of the document that has been filed. Each statement in this prospectus relating to a
document filed as an exhibit is qualified in all respects by the filed exhibit. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon completion of this offering, we will be subject to
the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers. Accordingly, we will be required to file reports and other information with the SEC, including annual reports on Form
<font style="white-space:nowrap">20-F</font> and current reports on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">6-K.</font> You can read our SEC filings, including the registration statement on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">F-1,</font> at the
SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. We also maintain a corporate website at www.arm.com and, upon the closing of this offering, you may access, free of charge, our annual reports on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">20-F</font> and current
reports on Form <font style="white-space:nowrap">6-K</font> and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. We have included our website address in
this prospectus solely as an inactive textual reference. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a foreign private issuer, we will be exempt from the rules under the Exchange
Act related to the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders will be exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act. In
addition, we will not be required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a foreign private issuer, we are also exempt from the requirements of Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) which, generally, are meant to ensure
that select groups of investors are not privy to specific information about an issuer before other investors. We are, however, still subject to the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation rules of the SEC, such as Rule
<font style="white-space:nowrap">10b-5</font> under the Exchange Act. Since many of the disclosure obligations required of us as a foreign private issuer are different than those required of U.S. domestic reporting companies, our shareholders,
potential shareholders and the investing public in general should not expect to receive information about us in the same amount, or at the same time, as information is received from, or provided by, U.S. domestic reporting companies. We are only
liable for violations of the rules and regulations of the SEC that apply to us as a foreign private issuer. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will send the depositary a
copy of all notices of shareholders meetings and other reports, communications and information that are made generally available to shareholders. The depositary has agreed to mail to all holders of ADSs a notice containing the information (or a
summary of the information) contained in any notice of a meeting of our shareholders received by the depositary and will make available to all holders of ADSs such notices and all such other reports and communications received by the depositary.

accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Arm Limited and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows,
for each of the three years in the period ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Basis for Opinion </b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards&nbsp;of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </p>

communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1)&nbsp;relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to
the financial statements and (2)&nbsp;involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. </p>

Company’s contracts and modifications may involve significant judgments by management, including determining whether the Company’s contracts represent new contracts or the modification of

Company”) is a global leader in the semiconductor industry. The Company’s principal operations are the licensing, marketing, research and development of microprocessors, systems intellectual property (“IP”), graphics processing
units, physical IP and associated systems IP, software, tools and other related services. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Principles of Consolidation </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
(“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company’s fiscal year ends on March 31<sup style="font-size:75%; vertical-align:top">st</sup>. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial statements consolidate all of the Company’s affiliates, and the entities where the Company holds a controlling financial interest, because
the Company holds a majority voting interest. The Company reevaluates whether there is a controlling financial interest in all entities when rights and interests change. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Foreign Currency </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying consolidated
financial statements are presented in U.S. dollar (“USD”), which is the Company’s functional and reporting currency. For most of the Company’s international operations, the local currency has been determined to be the functional
currency of the respective entity. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For transactions entered into in a currency other than its functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured into the functional currency at <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">end-of-period</font></font> exchange rates. <font style="white-space:nowrap">Non-monetary</font> assets and liabilities, along with equity
are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Income and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-monetary</font> balance sheet amounts, which
are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-operating</font> income (loss), net on the Consolidated Income Statements. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company translates functional currency assets and liabilities to their USD equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income
and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The USD effects that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Use of Estimates </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, share-based
compensation, impairment considerations for long-lived assets, fair value estimates and impairment for investments. The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis and revises estimates as circumstances change. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience, anticipated results, trends, and other various assumptions that it believes are reasonable. Inputs used in judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit risk is the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer or third-party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, short-term investments, derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable. The Company’s
maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of these assets. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by
international credit rating agencies. The Company further manages its credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of investment type and credit exposures. For accounts receivable, the credit risk is
managed through the use of mitigating controls, including the use of credit checks and credit limits on customers. For financial assets (other than accounts receivable), the Company holds positions with an approved list of investment-grade rated
counterparties and monitors the exposures and counterparty credit risk on a regular basis. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, in March 2022, the Company entered into a
Guarantee (as defined below) as discussed more fully in Note 19, <i>Commitments and Contingencies,</i> relating to the payment obligations under the Facility Agreement owed by Kronos (as defined below), an entity under common control of SoftBank
Group Corp. (“SoftBank Group”). Under the terms of the arrangements, a subsidiary of Kronos secured the obligations under the Facility Agreement (as defined below) by pledging its 75.01% interest in the Company and upon an Arm Guarantee
Trigger Event (as defined below) as discussed in Note 19, <i>Commitments and Contingencies</i>, the Company may become exposed to the credit risk of Kronos failing to pay its obligations, monetize the share collateral to settle the obligations
directly, or otherwise restructure the Facility Agreement before obligations are due. Upon default, the lenders can satisfy their claim either through foreclosing on the pledged 75.01% interest in the Company or through enforcing the Company’s
obligations pursuant to the Guarantee. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Cash and Cash Equivalents </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, short-term deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less that are readily
convertible into known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value because the short-term maturity of those instruments. </p>
<p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Short-term Investments </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Short-term investments
represent term deposits with banks with a maturity between three and 12 months. These investments are classified as <font style="white-space:nowrap"><font style="white-space:nowrap">held-to-maturity</font></font> as the Company has the intent and
ability to hold the investments to maturity. These investments are recorded at amortized cost, net of expected credit losses. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts are included in interest income (expense), net on the Consolidated
Income Statements. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Equity Investments </i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

indicated market values of the underlying assets or investment portfolios. Income statement activity for all equity investments is recorded in income from equity investments, net on the Consolidated Income Statements. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The carrying values of <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-marketable</font> equity securities under the measurement alternative are adjusted for qualifying
observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within the Company’s portfolio requires
judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying values of equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair values of the
Company’s equity securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. </p>

the fair value option (collectively referred to as <font style="white-space:nowrap">“non-marketable</font> equity securities”) are also subject to periodic impairment analysis. The quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative
and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee’s fair value. Qualitative factors considered include the investee’s financial condition and business outlook, industry and sector performance, market for
technology, operational and financing cash flow activities, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, the Company prepares quantitative assessments of the fair value of the <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-marketable</font> equity securities using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenue and costs, and comparable market data of
private and public companies, among others. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><font style="white-space:nowrap">Non-marketable</font> equity securities under the measurement alternative
are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used to test goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment. Upon determining an impairment may exist, the security’s fair value is calculated and compared to its
carrying value and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds fair value. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Equity method investments not measured under the
fair value option are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a decline in fair value below cost and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the
investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery. </p>

The Company maintains an allowance for current expected credit losses to reserve for potentially uncollectible loans receivable. The Company measures interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective

defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). When determining fair value, the Company considers the
principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Business Combinations </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, which requires separate recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
from goodwill, based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the fair value of any
<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-controlling</font> interests in the acquiree over the net of the estimated acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible
assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and the useful lives of the assets. Although the Company’s fair value estimates
are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result,
during the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period or final
determination of fair values of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings on the Consolidated Income Statements. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the
business combination and expensed as incurred. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Goodwill </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during
the fourth fiscal quarter or during interim periods whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of fair value at the Company’s
reporting unit level, which is the same or one level below the operating segment level. The Company determined it has one reporting unit. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has
the option to assess qualitative factors first to determine whether it is necessary to perform the <font style="white-space:nowrap">two-step</font> test. If the Company believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is <font style="white-space:nowrap">more-likely-than-not</font> that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the <font style="white-space:nowrap">two-step</font> quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further
testing is required. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers primary factors such as industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023. It was determined, after
performing a qualitative review, it was not <font style="white-space:nowrap">more-likely-than-not</font> that the fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. Accordingly, there was no indication of
impairment. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Intangible Assets, Net </i></b></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including those acquired separately, such as computer software and purchased patents and
licenses to use technology, as well as those acquired through business combination such as <font style="white-space:nowrap">in-process</font> research and development (“IPR&amp;D”), developed technology, and customer relationship assets.
</p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company initially records intangible assets acquired in a business combination at their estimated fair value. Intangible assets are reported net of
accumulated amortization and are amortized over their estimated useful lives at amortization rates that are proportionate to each asset’s estimated economic benefit. The Company initially </p>

judgment when determining the amount of consideration, it expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. This includes estimates as to whether, and to what extent, subsequent concessions or payments
may be granted to customers, which release customers from their obligations to pay contractual fees. In this judgment, historical trends are considered with respect to both the specific customer and broader Company trends. The Company estimates the
transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. Consideration payable to a customer is accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue
unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service that the customer transfers to the Company. The transaction price also excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as sales taxes. The Company’s
revenue arrangements may include variable consideration, including royalties. Where minimum royalties are agreed with customers and there is no uncertainty of their receipt, the amount is allocated to performance obligations as a part of the
transaction price. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company considers relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether a contract contains a significant financing component. The

whether the pricing of certain performance obligations is highly variable or uncertain. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other than support and maintenance, SSPs are usually not directly
observable for the Company’s products and services because the Company generally does not sell its products or services on a standalone basis. The Company estimates the SSPs so that the Company allocates the transaction price to each
performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer. The Company allocates royalties entirely to the
licenses that give rise to them. When estimating a SSP, the Company considers available information and maximizes the use of observable inputs such as renewal pricing history for the Company’s standardized support and professional service
offerings. </p>

based on a cost-plus margin approach, the transaction price is allocated by applying a residual approach. This is on the basis that the Company has identified SSP for other performance obligations in the same arrangement. If two or more goods or
services in a contract have highly variable or uncertain pricing, then the Company applies a combination of methods to allocate transaction price, including utilizing list prices, contract prices, and effort estimates of future IPs, for initial
allocation of residual amount of transaction price within such products. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For customer agreements related to long-term licensing of architecture IP, the

Special Administrative Region, but excludes Taiwan (collectively referred to as the “PRC”), under the intellectual property licensing arrangement (“IPLA”). Arm China directly contracts with end customers with discretion in
establishing pricing to sublicense specified IP. The Company’s responsibility under the IPLA is to facilitate delivery of a good or service to the end customer in accordance with detailed instructions and other specifications from Arm China. In
these cases, Arm China is the customer for the Company. As such, revenue presented by the Company is the net amount calculated as a percentage of license and royalty fees earned by Arm China from <font style="white-space:nowrap">sub-license</font>
arrangements entered into with end customers. The Company applies the royalty exception, under which revenue is recognized when the subsequent sale or usage occurs, assuming control of the license to which the royalty relates has transferred to the
customer. Where the revenue is derived as a percentage of the license fee of Arm China, the Company categorizes that portion as license revenue while the other portion, which represents the Company’s share of Arm China’s royalties, is
categorized as royalties. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Contract Balances and Receivables </i></p>
<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes accounts receivable in full when it has the contractual right to invoice the customer and begins satisfying the performance obligation
over the term of the contract. Judgment is required to determine whether a right to consideration is unconditional and thus qualifies as a receivable. Contract assets are recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied and the Company does
not have the contractual right to invoice. Accrued royalties are presented as accrued income in accounts receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Contract liabilities primarily reflect invoices due, or payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Typically, the Company invoices either all or a
substantial portion of the fees for IP licenses upfront on the effective date of the contract. Periodic fixed fees for software support services, and other multi-period agreements are typically invoiced in advance. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment
within 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined that its contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of the
Company’s invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a license term with revenue recognized over the contract period, and not to
receive financing from customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of the Company’s contracts. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Allowance
for Current Expected Credit Losses </i></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Trade receivables are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects the
Company’s best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit
losses, accounts receivable is segmented into pools of assets depending on market (China versus international) and delinquency status, and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of accounts receivables. To determine the reserve
percentages for each pool of accounts receivables, the Company considers its historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future
forecasted macroeconomic factors. These credit risk indicators are monitored on a quarterly basis to determine whether there are any changes in the economic environment that would indicate the established reserve percentages should be adjusted and
are considered on a regional basis to reflect more geographic-specific metrics. Please refer to Note 3, <i>Revenue</i>, for the summary of the movement in the allowance for current expected credit losses. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables are tracked against collections on a quarterly basis to determine whether the reserve
percentages remain appropriate. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded. Accounts receivables are written off after all reasonable
means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) are exhausted. For the years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were immaterial to the consolidated financial

RSUs are granted by tranches either with a fixed number of awards or with fixed monetary amounts known at inception. Depending on the type of award, RSUs may require the achievement of certain performance conditions, market-conditions and for
certain awards, vesting occurs on the earliest of the following: (1)&nbsp;the occurrence of one of various events comprising a change in control of the Company, (2)&nbsp;an initial public offering of the Company’s ordinary shares, and
(3)&nbsp;the passage of time. The number of RSUs that vest is determined by the achievement of market, performance and service conditions. The market condition target is tied to the valuation of the Company upon vesting. At the discretion of the
Company’s remuneration committee, each RSU is settled in cash or converts into ordinary shares on the vesting date. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company expenses share-based

The fair value of RSUs is determined on the date of grant for equity-classified awards, and at the end of each reporting period for liability-classified awards, using Monte Carlo simulations or
the discounted cash flow approach. The fair value of Phantom Shares is determined on the date of grant and at the end of each reporting period based on the share price of the Company’s ultimate parent, SoftBank Group. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company classifies those awards in which the Company has the option, pursuant to the plan terms, and intends to settle in cash or equity, as
liability-classified or equity-classified awards, respectively. Phantom Shares and certain RSUs are liability-classified and are remeasured at the end of each reporting period through the date of settlement so that the expense recognized for each
award is equivalent to the amount to be paid in cash. Changes in the fair value of liability-classified RSUs are recorded in the income statement over the vesting period of the award. Equity-classified RSUs are recognized using the straight-line
method over the service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A change in control or an initial public offering is generally not considered probable
until it has occurred. Accordingly, as of the balance sheet date, those RSUs that are subject to vesting on the earliest of (1)&nbsp;change of control, (2)&nbsp;initial public offering, or (3)&nbsp;passage of time, are expected to vest and be
settled in cash upon the passage of time. For liability-classified awards, the weighted average fair value of the RSUs was measured at each reporting date using the Monte Carlo simulation model or a discounted cash flow approach. Similarly, the fair
value for equity-classified awards was measured at the grant date using the discounted cash flow approach. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2021,
the Company used the discounted cash flow approach based on the expected value of the Company as a result of a business combination which was considered likely. For fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, the Company used the Monte Carlo
simulation model, the income approach and/or market-calibration approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses to measure the RSUs. The Monte Carlo simulation model simulates the Company’s equity value at
an assumed listing exit event in order to determine the RSU vesting percentage. The model simulates the RSU vesting percentage over numerous iterations, and the average of all iterations is determined to be the fair value of an RSU. The model then
discounts the future value of the RSU at the assumed listing exit event date back to the valuation date based on the relevant risk-free interest rate. The Monte Carlo simulation model incorporates various assumptions such as expected stock price
volatility until a liquidity event, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and expected time to complete an initial public offering. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Company granted Phantom Shares and executive RSUs to certain of our executive officers and are subject to continuous service and vest upon meeting certain strategic performance conditions of the Company. Phantom Shares and executive RSUs are
liability-classified and are expensed when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. Executive RSUs primarily are based on fixed monetary amounts that could be converted into a variable number of shares based on the closing
share price of the Company upon an initial public offering. Any obligations that are based predominantly on fixed monetary amounts that are known at inception and are to be settled with a variable number of the Company’s shares, are
liability-classified with compensation cost recognized ratably over the requisite service period. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the grant date of the RSUs, the Company was private
and its ordinary shares were not listed on a public stock exchange. Therefore, the Company’s Board of Directors exercised its reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of fair
value of the Company’s ordinary shares underlying share-based compensation awards, including: </p> <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The income approach estimates enterprise value based on the estimated present value of future cash flows the business is expected to generate over its
remaining life. The estimated present value is calculated using a discount rate reflective of the risks associated with an investment in a similar company in a similar industry or having a similar history of revenue growth. For each valuation, the
Company prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the value of invested capital for both the income approach and market-calibration approach. The financial forecast considered the Company’s past results and expected future
financial performance. The risk associated with achieving this forecast was assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates as the assumptions used are highly subjective and subject to changes as
a result of new operating data and economic and other conditions that impact the business. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market-calibration approach analyzes the percent change in
the enterprise values of peer companies between the prior valuation date and the current valuation date. Based on the observed market movement in the enterprise values of peer companies, a market movement factor is selected to represent the
potential shift in enterprise value between the prior valuation date and the current valuation date. The selected market movement factor is applied to the indicated value as of the prior valuation date. </p>

highly subjective assumptions could significantly impact share-based compensation cost. Since the Company’s ordinary shares were not publicly traded, the computation of expected volatility was based on the average of historical and implied
volatilities over the expected term of the awards of a representative peer group of publicly traded entities. Other assumptions included expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.

on whether employees are required to render service beyond a minimum retention period in order to receive the termination benefits. If employees are required to render service beyond a minimum retention period in order to receive the termination
benefits, costs are recognized ratably over the applicable future service period. Otherwise, costs are recognized when the Company has committed to a restructuring plan and has communicated those actions to employees. Employee termination benefits
covered by existing benefit arrangements are recognized when the Company has committed to a restructuring plan and the termination benefits are probable and estimable. </p>

for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be
realized or settled. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Company determines it is more likely than not that it will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the value of
some or all deferred tax assets (net of deferred tax liabilities), the Company will establish a valuation allowance offsetting the amount it does not expect to realize. The Company performs this analysis each reporting period and reduces the
measurement of deferred taxes if the likelihood the Company will realize them becomes uncertain. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Deferred tax assets the Company records each period
depend primarily on the ability to generate future taxable income. Each period, the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets and, if necessary, adjusts the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax
assets are recorded only to the extent the Company concludes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. If the outlook for future taxable income changes significantly, the Company’s assessment of the need for,
and the amount of, a valuation allowance may also change. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is also required to evaluate and quantify other sources of taxable income, such as
the possible reversal of future deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Evaluating and quantifying these amounts is difficult and involves significant judgment, based on all of the available evidence and
assumptions about future activities. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it
is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely
to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized within income tax (expense) benefit on the Consolidated Income Statements. </p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Basic income (loss) per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and potentially dilutive ordinary shares outstanding
during the period. Potentially dilutive ordinary shares whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per ordinary share. </p>

as a discontinued operation if the disposal group is a component of an entity or group of components that meets the held for sale criteria, is disposed of by sale or other than by sale, and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major
effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. The results of disposals that qualify as a discontinued operation are presented as such for all reporting periods presented. Results of discontinued operations include all revenues and
expenses directly derived from such disposal group; general corporate overhead is not allocated to a discontinued operation. For disposals other than by sale such as a distribution to shareholders of the Company, results of operations of a business
would not be recorded as a discontinued operation until the period in which the business is actually disposed of other than by sale. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following a
strategic decision to place greater focus on the Company’s core technology licensing business, a decision was made to distribute or sell certain components of the Company’s Internet of Things business. As a result, in June 2021, the
Company completed a pro rata distribution of its controlling stake in Treasure Data, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Treasure Data”) to the immediate shareholders of the Company. In November 2021, the Company sold 100% of its ownership in
Pelion IOT Limited and its subsidiaries (“IoTP”) to SoftBank Group Capital Limited in exchange for $12.0&nbsp;million in cash consideration. The distribution of Treasure Data and sale of IoTP were accounted for as discontinued operations.
</p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Revenue from IoTP and Treasure Data reported in loss on discontinued operations before income taxes on the Consolidated Income Statements relates to
certain IP available through cloud-based infrastructure where the customer does not have the right to terminate the hosting contract. Under such arrangements, customers do not have the right to take possession of the software to run on their own IT
infrastructure, nor do they have the right to engage a third-party provider to host and manage the software. Revenue for these arrangements is recognized over time as the services are performed. </p>

results. In the course of the Company’s evaluation, it considered examples provided in ASC <font style="white-space:nowrap">205-20</font> of what may constitute a strategic shift that will
have a major effect on operations and financial results. The following metrics were analyzed among others: total revenues of Treasure Data and IoTP when compared to those of the Company, total assets, losses and profits before and after taxes,
respectively. As a result of this analysis, the Company determined the distribution and sale of the businesses qualified for classification as discontinued operations. Because Treasure Data was distributed to the immediate shareholders of the
Company and IoTP was sold to SoftBank Group Capital Limited, the results of operations were not recorded as discontinued operations until the period in which the businesses were actually disposed of other than by sale. </p>

a pro rata distribution of its controlling stake in Treasure Data to SoftBank Group Capital Limited. The distribution was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings at the carrying amount of Treasure Data’s net assets of $44.2&nbsp;million
and did not result in the recognition of gain or losses. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon the distribution, the Company and Treasure Data entered into a transition services
agreement pursuant to which the Company provided enabling functions support services to the owners of Treasure Data on an interim transitional basis for up to three months after disposition. The revenue and cash flows associated with this transition
services agreement were not significant to the operations of the Company. The Company completed its transition services for Treasure Data during the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2022. The Company provided no transition services in the fiscal

March&nbsp;31, 2023 and recorded as an other receivable in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon the sale, the carrying value of the net assets of IoTP equaled total consideration and no gain or loss was
recognized. The Company provided no transition services to IoTP post-distribution in the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022. </p>

For the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized gains from changes in fair value of $1.7&nbsp;million, $40.0&nbsp;million and $8.3&nbsp;million,

restructuring its investment in March 2022, the Company held an equity method investment in Arm China. Factors resulting in significant influence included: (a)&nbsp;the Company held a 48.18% equity holding in Arm China with associated rights;
(b)&nbsp;the Company was party to the IPLA and has service share transactions with Arm China, along with certain leases; and (c)&nbsp;the Company had the ability to nominate a representative to Arm China’s board of directors. The Company
elected to apply the fair value option to this equity method investment. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the IPLA, a substantial portion of customer contracts previously
held by the Company’s former PRC subsidiary were novated to Arm China; under such contracts the Company is entitled to a share of revenue earned by Arm China. Where contracts were not novated from the Company’s former PRC subsidiary to Arm
China, the Company has an obligation to pay a reseller fee on the revenue derived from those entities within the PRC geography. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2022, the
Company transferred its interest in Arm China to Acetone Limited, a newly created company.&nbsp;Immediately thereafter, the Company transferred 67% of its interest in Acetone Limited, to SoftBank Group Capital Limited (“SBGC”), and 23% of
its interest in SVF Holdco Limited (“SVF”) for a note receivable of $930.3&nbsp;million (the “Note Receivable”).&nbsp;The Note Receivable was immediately distributed proportionally to SBGC and SVF (the Company’s only
shareholders), both entities under common control of SoftBank Group, free of cost and accordingly, treated similar to a dividend or distribution to the immediate shareholders of the Company as a reduction to retained earnings. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company retained a 10% <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-voting</font> shareholding interest in Acetone Limited. The Company concluded it did not
control Acetone Limited, as its 10% shareholding interest is a <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-voting</font> interest, and the Company did not have any rights to nominate a director to Acetone Limited’s board of directors. However, the
Company did conclude that it has significant influence in Acetone Limited, as (a)&nbsp;Acetone Limited’s sole asset is its 48.18% equity holding in Arm China, (b)&nbsp;the Company is party to the IPLA with Arm China, (c)&nbsp;the Company has
significant inter-entity transactions with Arm China, including leased assets; and (d)&nbsp;the Company’s Chief Executive Officer has been appointed to Arm China’s board of directors by SoftBank Group. The Company elected to apply the fair
value option to this retained equity method investment. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of these transactions, in March 2022, the Company removed the carrying value of its
equity investment in Arm China of $1,084.1&nbsp;million and recognized its investment in Acetone Limited at $108.4&nbsp;million, with net distribution to immediate shareholders of the Company recognized as a reduction to retained earnings of
$975.7&nbsp;million. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of the Company’s equity method investment in Acetone Limited was $92.4&nbsp;million and $108.4&nbsp;million, respectively </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized fair value gains of $72.3&nbsp;million, and $132.5&nbsp;million, respectively
in connection with equity method investment in Arm China, and immaterial amounts associated with its retained interest in Acetone Limited. For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company recognized fair value losses of $16.0&nbsp;million

March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company recognized a loss from changes in fair value of $10.5 million for non-marketable securities accounted for under the NAV practical expedient. Accordingly, the Company recognized gains from changes in fair value of

receivable </i></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company issued a four-year loan of $25.0&nbsp;million to Arduino SA (“Arduino”) in July 2017. In March 2020, the Company
amended the terms of the loan receivable by reducing the annual interest rate from 6% to 3% and in conjunction with the amendment, the Company received Series A preferred stock of Arduino to partially settle the loan receivable. In April 2022, the
Company received Series B preferred stock in Arduino of $5.1&nbsp;million to partially settle the loan receivable. The Company accounts for this investment using the measurement alternative because such security is not publicly traded and does not
have a readily determinable fair value. For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2021, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $11.0&nbsp;million related to such investment. For the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, the Company
did not record any impairment related to such investment. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2021, the Company further amended the terms of the loan receivable by extending the
maturity date from July 2021 to April 2027. These amendments were accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring. Under the troubled debt restructuring, unamortized fees and costs are carried forward and continue to be included in the amortized cost
basis of the loan receivable. Other direct third-party costs incurred were expensed as incurred and were included in other <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-operating</font> income (loss), net on the Consolidated Income Statements. The Company
did not receive any fees in connection with these troubled debt restructurings. There were no payment defaults as the accrued interest and the principal amount of the loan receivable was only required to be repaid at maturity. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2021, the loan receivable of $23.0&nbsp;million from Arduino was impaired in full as the balance was not expected to
be recovered, resulting in the recognition of an expected credit loss of $23.0&nbsp;million. The expected credit loss was recorded in other <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-operating</font> income (loss), net on the Consolidated Income
Statements. For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company reduced the allowance for expected credit losses given the change in collectability with a corresponding reversal expense for the portion of the loan receivable that was repaid
in exchange for Series B preferred stock in Arduino. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the aforementioned Arduino loan receivable, the remaining balance for the fiscal year
ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022 comprised a four-year loan of $3.0&nbsp;million issued to Cerfe Labs, Inc., included in other loans receivable. The loan is at an interest rate comparable to market interest rates, with repayment due upon maturity.

third-party valuation specialist or based on inputs from the investee. The fair value computation is updated on a quarterly basis. The investments are classified within Level&nbsp;3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the fair
value of the investments using (i)&nbsp;the market-calibration approach based on the guideline public company method and/or (ii)&nbsp;subject to availability of sufficient information, the income approach based on the discounted cash flow method and
iii) the probability-weighted, expected return (“PWER”) approach. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market-calibration approach considers valuation multiples that are
calibrated to the valuation as of the prior valuation date (i.e., quarterly) based on: (a)&nbsp;changes in the broader market or industry; (b)&nbsp;changes in the guideline public companies; and (c)&nbsp;changes in the company’s operating and
financial performance. The fair value computation under this approach includes a key assumption for the range of valuation multiples (i.e., enterprise value or revenue), which requires significant professional judgment by the valuation specialist
and is based on observable inputs (e.g., market data) and unobservable inputs (e.g., market participant assumptions). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to March&nbsp;31, 2022, the
income approach was used to measure the fair value of Ampere. For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, the PWERM approach was used for the fair value measurement. The PWER approach is based on discrete future exit scenarios to determine the
value of various equity securities. Under the PWER approach, the share value today is based on the probability-weighted, present value of expected future distributions, taking into account the rights and preferences of each debt and equity class.
The Company considers an initial public offering scenario, a sale scenario, and a scenario assuming continued operation as a private entity for future exit scenarios. The fair value computation under this approach includes key assumptions for time
to liquidity outcomes, discounted rate, and present value factors. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following table provides quantitative information related to certain key
assumptions utilized in the valuation of equity method investments accounted for under the fair value option: </p> <p style="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2021, the Company acquired a $29.0&nbsp;million convertible promissory note in Ampere, which is included in other
<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-current</font> assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss are the amounts invested in, and advanced to, Ampere. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023 and
2022, the Company has not converted any of its convertible promissory note into equity. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of the Ampere convertible loan is based upon
significant unobservable inputs, including the use of a probability weighted discounted cash flows model, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. Therefore, the Company has categorized this asset as a Level&nbsp;3 financial asset. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of the more significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the convertible loan include applicable discount rates, the likelihood
and projected timing of repayment or conversion, and projected cash flows in support of the estimated enterprise value of Ampere. Changes in these assumptions, while holding other inputs constant, could result in a significant change in the fair
value of the convertible loan. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the amortized cost of the convertible loan exceeds its estimated fair value, the security is deemed to be impaired, and
must be evaluated for the recognition of credit losses. Impairment resulting from credit losses is recognized within earnings, while impairment resulting from other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). As of March&nbsp;31,
2023 and 2022, the Company has not recognized any credit losses related to this convertible loan. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value calculated using significant
unobservable inputs did not differ materially from the amortized cost basis for the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Currency

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2019, an RSU plan was established for all employees of the Company. Vesting of these RSUs under the 2019 AEP requires the continuous service of the
employees through the vesting date, is subject to the achievement of a market condition target, and vesting occurs on the earliest of the following: (1)&nbsp;the occurrence of one of various events comprising a change in control of the Company,
(2)&nbsp;an initial public offering, or (3)&nbsp;the passage of time with the date being March&nbsp;9, 2026. The market condition target is tied to the valuation of the Company upon vesting. The plan allows for either share or cash settlement of the
RSUs at the discretion of the Company’s remuneration committee. Upon the occurrence of a change in control or an initial public offering, and at the discretion of the Company’s remuneration committee, each RSU converts into one ordinary
share on the vesting date. Conversely, upon the passage of time, each RSU is settled in cash at the vesting date. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For all periods presented, a change in
control or an initial public offering is generally not considered probable until it has occurred. Accordingly, the RSUs will only be settled in cash upon the passage of time and are accounted as liability-classified awards. The Company also
maintains a subplan for employees of its subsidiary, Arm Technology Israel Ltd. (“Arm Israel”), in which RSUs will be settled in cash at the vesting date upon the occurrence of a change in control, initial public offering or the passage of
time with a long-stop date of March&nbsp;9, 2026. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Vesting requires continuous service until the passage of time and employees may elect not to
participate in the plan. RSUs are settled in cash at the vesting date and neither carry rights to dividends nor voting rights. Awards are forfeited if an employee leaves the Company before the RSUs vest. For all periods presented, the aggregate
nominal amount of shares over which the Company’s remuneration committee may grant awards under the 2019 AEP will be limited so that it does not exceed at any time an amount equal to 2.2&nbsp;percent of the aggregate nominal amount of the
Company’s fully diluted equity share capital. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 11,601,185, 13,507,360 and 14,817,424 RSUs were outstanding, respectively. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, $56.0&nbsp;million, 30.8&nbsp;million and $37.5&nbsp;million of share-based compensation cost
respectively, and $11.6&nbsp;million, $5.4&nbsp;million and $3.2&nbsp;million of tax benefit, respectively, was recognized. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, $114.2&nbsp;million and $74.0&nbsp;million was recognized as a liability for the
liability-classified RSUs under the 2019 AEP in the <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-current</font> portion of accrued compensation and share-based compensation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, there

of the Company, (2)&nbsp;an initial public offering, or (3)&nbsp;the passage of time with the date being March&nbsp;9, 2026. At inception of the plan, the market condition target was tied to the valuation of the Company upon vesting. In September
2022, the Company modified the 2019 EIP to remove the market conditions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2019 EIP allows for either share or cash settlement of the RSUs at the
discretion of the Company’s remuneration committee. Upon the occurrence of a change in control or an initial public offering, and at the discretion of the Company’s remuneration committee, each RSU converts into one ordinary share on the
vesting date. Conversely, upon the passage of time, each RSU is settled in cash at the vesting date. For all periods presented, a change in control or an initial public offering is generally not considered probable until it has occurred.
Accordingly, the RSUs would only be settled in cash upon the passage of time and were accounted as liability-classified awards. Employees require continuous service until the passage of time and may elect not to participate in the 2019 EIP. RSUs are
settled in cash at the vesting date and neither carry rights to dividends nor voting rights. Awards are forfeited if an employee leaves the Company before the RSUs vest. For all periods presented, the aggregate nominal amount of shares over which
the Company’s remuneration committee may grant awards under the 2019 EIP will be limited so that it does not exceed at any time an amount equal to 0.3&nbsp;percent of the aggregate nominal amount of the Company’s fully diluted equity share
capital. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 192,999, 903,925 and 2,214,568 RSUs were outstanding, respectively. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2022, the Company
modified the 2019 EIP to remove the market conditions which were tied to the valuation of the Company upon the vesting of the RSUs. All other terms under the 2019 EIP remained unchanged as a result of this modification and the RSUs remained as
liability-classified awards. The incremental share-based compensation cost was measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified RSUs over the fair value of the original RSUs immediately before their terms were modified at modification. As of
the modification date, incremental share-based compensation cost recognized was $4.5&nbsp;million. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2022, the Company’s remuneration
committee approved the cancellation of 355,463 outstanding RSUs issued to an executive participant under the 2019 EIP in exchange for a fixed monetary $20.0&nbsp;million </p>

special RSU award (“Special RSU Award”) issued under the 2022 Arm Limited RSU Award Plan. The incremental compensation cost of both the 2019 EIP and the Special RSU Award combined was
measured by comparing the fair value of the award immediately before and after the modification. The Company accounted for this acceleration for the modification as a cumulative adjustment to the liability. As of the modification date, the net
incremental compensation cost for the modified award was $4.1&nbsp;million. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,
$0.1&nbsp;million, $(0.5) million and $4.1&nbsp;million, of share-based compensation cost (credit) was recognized in connection with awards issued under the 2019 EIP. The share-based compensation cost decrease and credit for the fiscal years ended
March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022 were attributable to the replacement awards issued in December 2022 and executive departures, respectively. There were no tax impacts related to the 2019 EIP RSUs for the fiscal years ended March&nbsp;31, 2022. For the
fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2021, the tax expense and benefit recorded was $0.4 million and $0.7&nbsp;million, respectively. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023 and 2022, $3.6&nbsp;million and $3.5&nbsp;million, was recognized in the <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-current</font> portion of accrued compensation and share-based compensation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, there was $3.6&nbsp;million of total unrecognized compensation
cost related to liability-classified RSUs under the 2019 EIP expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of&nbsp;2.94&nbsp;years. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The table

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2022, the 2022 RSU Plan was established to grant RSUs to all employees of the Company (“All Employee Awards”). Employees may elect not to
participate in the plan. The RSUs vest in tranches, require continuous service through the vesting date and are subject to graded vesting over time. The 2022 RSU Plan provides vesting schedules applicable prior to and after an initial public
offering. For all periods, an initial public offering is generally not considered probable until it has occurred. Accordingly, the RSUs are currently probable of vesting based on the vesting schedule applicable prior to an initial public offering
over a three-year period and will vest by tranche through March 2025. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2022 RSU Plan allows for either cash or share settlement of the RSUs by tranche
at the discretion of the Company’s remuneration committee. At the time of issuance, the Company intended to settle the RSUs in shares at the vesting date and such RSUs are accounted for as equity-classified awards. The Company recognizes share
based compensation cost using the straight-line method over the service period of the award except for performance grants with specific performance criteria, net of estimated forfeitures. These RSUs neither carry rights to dividends nor voting
rights until the shares are issued or transferred to the recipient. Awards are forfeited if an employee leaves the Company before the RSUs vest. For all periods presented, the aggregate nominal amount of shares over which the Company’s
remuneration committee may grant awards under the 2022 RSU Plan will be limited so that it does not exceed at any time an amount equal to 4.0&nbsp;percent of the aggregate nominal amount of the Company’s fully diluted equity share capital. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company granted additional awards under the 2022 RSU Plan to new hires, starting in September 2022 (“New Starter Awards”). The New Starter
Awards share substantially the same terms as the existing RSUs for All Employee Awards with changes limited to the vesting schedules. The New Starter Awards require continuous service through each vesting date. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company also granted additional RSUs to all employees and new hires of its subsidiary, Arm Israel, starting in February 2023 (the “Israel
Awards”). The Israel Awards share substantially have the same terms as the existing RSUs for All Employee Awards and New Starter Awards with changes limited to the vesting schedules. The Israel Awards require continuous service through the
vesting date. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2022, the Company determined that it would settle the first tranche of the RSUs outstanding that vest in March and May 2023 by
paying cash instead of issuing equity. Other than the change in intent regarding form of settlement, no other terms or conditions regarding the RSUs were changed. The Company accounted for this change as a modification in accordance with ASC 718,
<i>Compensation—Stock Compensation,</i> and reclassified the affected portion of the award from equity to liability and will remeasure the award at fair value at each reporting period through the date of settlement with consideration that total
compensation cost cannot be less than the grant-date fair-value-based measure of the original award. As a result of the modification, the Company recognized $2.1&nbsp;million of incremental share-based compensation cost at the time of the
modification and recorded $31.7&nbsp;million as a reclassification from equity to liability upon modification. 5,539 of employees were affected by this modification. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Launch Awards vest in tranches and require continuous service through the vesting dates and are subject to
graded vesting over a period of three years. The Company also granted Launch Awards with customized vesting schedules to certain members of the Executive Committee with a potential fixed monetary amount of $55.0&nbsp;million at the grant date. These
customized awards vest upon (1)&nbsp;the occurrence of one of various events comprising a change in control of the Company, (2)&nbsp;an initial public offering, and (3)&nbsp;March&nbsp;9, 2026. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Annual Awards include a portion that vests over a three-year continuous service period and another portion that is subject to continuous service and
satisfaction of certain Company performance conditions. The time-based portion of the Annual Awards vest over a three-year period. The Annual Awards that are subject to continuous service and satisfaction of certain Company performance conditions
vest upon the satisfaction of performance metrics as established for each <font style="white-space:nowrap">one-year</font> performance period and have the potential to vest between 0% and 200% of original fixed monetary amount of the award depending
on the achievement of annual performance metrics. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon an initial public offering, and at the discretion of the Company’s remuneration committee,
each Executive Award could be converted into a variable number of shares based on the closing share price of the Company at the initial public offering date. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, awards are expected to settle in cash at the vesting date.
Awards are forfeited if an employee leaves the Company before the awards vest. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, $32.2&nbsp;million in
share-based compensation cost and $6.2 million of tax benefit, was recognized in connection with the Executive Awards granted under the 2022 RSU Plan. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, $32.2&nbsp;million was recognized as a liability comprising
$18.4&nbsp;million and $13.8&nbsp;million in the current portion and <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-current</font> liability, respectively for the liability-classified Executive Awards granted under the 2022 RSU Plan on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, there was $62.8 million&nbsp;of total unrecognized compensation cost related to liability-classified Executive Awards expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of&nbsp;2.6&nbsp;years </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company did not have any payments arising from normal course vesting events for liability-classified awards for the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023.
As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, none of the Executive Awards granted under the 2022 RSU Plan have vested. The table below shows the Company’s commitment for potential payments and the liability recognized as of March&nbsp;31, 2023: </p>

</tbody></table> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company had a United Kingdom corporate tax loss carryforward of $42&nbsp;million
($10&nbsp;million tax effected) and U.K. R&amp;D Expenditure Credits of $37&nbsp;million. These tax losses have no expiration date. The Company has U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14&nbsp;million ($3&nbsp;million tax
effected) of which $1&nbsp;million has no expiration date and $13&nbsp;million ($3&nbsp;million tax effected) will expire between fiscal years 2033 and 2038 if not utilized. The Company also has a tax asset in respect of state net operating losses
of $46&nbsp;million ($3&nbsp;million net of federal benefit) which will expire between fiscal years 2025 and 2043 if not utilized. The Company has U.S. Federal tax credit carryforwards of $72&nbsp;million which will expire between 2035 and 2043. In
addition, the Company has state tax credits of $37&nbsp;million ($29&nbsp;million net of federal benefit) of which $22&nbsp;million has no expiration date and $15&nbsp;million will expire between 2037 and 2043. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company has provided a valuation allowance on certain U.K. tax losses and US State R&amp;D tax credits. This is based on an
analysis of historical taxable income, the projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. The Company believes, more likely than not, that it will have sufficient taxable income to utilize its
remaining deferred tax assets. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Utilization of the U.S. federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due
to the ownership change limitations provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before
their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three-year period. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $154&nbsp;million of cumulative undistributed earnings of its U.S.
subsidiaries and no deferred tax liability was recorded for these undistributed earnings. </p>

to litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While the results of any litigation or other legal proceedings are uncertain, management does not believe the ultimate resolution of any pending legal matters is likely to
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company accrues for loss contingencies when it is both probable that it will incur the loss and when the Company can reasonably
estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. In the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company recorded a $40.0&nbsp;million loss contingency related to an offer made by the Company in respect of an ongoing contract dispute between the
Company and a <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-top</font> five customer. That particular customer’s claims arise from a contract dating to a very early period in the Company’s history and that contract is both <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-standard</font> and significantly dissimilar from other customers’ contracts. The Company took into consideration advice received from experts in the specific matter and current status of settlement negotiations,
which may be ongoing. A complaint has not been filed by either party, and the Company and the customer are involved in ongoing negotiations to resolve the dispute outside of court. The Company can provide no assurances as to the ultimate resolution
of this dispute or whether it will ultimately be litigated or to the ultimate costs that will be associated with a resolution. The liability of $40.0&nbsp;million is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. No other
material amounts related to litigation settlements were recognized in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Kronos Guarantee

of SoftBank Group arranging a facility agreement (the “Facility Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan SE as Facility Agent to be secured by its 75.01% equity interest in the Company. SoftBank Group pledged its ownership interest in the Company by
transferring such interest to an entity that sits between Kronos and the Company, and SoftBank Group has no further obligation under the Facility Agreement. The Company is in compliance with all applicable operating and financial covenants pursuant
to the Facility Agreement for the fiscal years presented. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Facility Agreement, the lenders initially were committed to make up to
$8.0&nbsp;billion of funds available to Kronos under a “Bridge Facility” and “Term Facility” (together with the Bridge Facility, the “Facility”). In March 2022, the Term Facility was funded for $7.1&nbsp;billion and the

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2022, an amendment was executed which expanded the total commitment of the Term Facility to
$8.5&nbsp;billion via an additional term facility of $1.4&nbsp;billion, $0.9&nbsp;billion of which was used to repay the Bridge Facility in full with the remaining $0.5&nbsp;billion representing incremental debt. The Term Facility matures on the
earlier of two years after Kronos draws upon the facility or three months after the effective date of a public listing of the Company’s ordinary shares. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beyond the pledge of the 75.01% interest in the Company as collateral for the Facility, in March 2022, the Company entered into the Arm Undertaking (the
“Undertaking”) to confirm and agree to comply with certain terms of the Facility Agreement (including operational restrictions) and a springing guarantee and indemnity agreement (the “Guarantee”) with J.P. Morgan SE. The
Guarantee commences upon an “Arm Guarantee Trigger Event,” which includes a public listing of the Company’s ordinary shares not occurring within 18 months of the closing date of the Facility or any public announcement or notice to
lenders that a listing will not be undertaken and failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with the obligations under the Undertaking. Until an Arm Guarantee Trigger Event occurs, the Company is not obligated to perform or make payment
on the obligations of Kronos. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once an Arm Guarantee Trigger Event has occurred, the Company guarantees all overdue payments under the Facility Agreement.
The total commitment is $8.5&nbsp;billion and would only become a potential obligation to the Company if Kronos were to default on any such obligation, as Kronos remains the primary obligor under the Facility Agreement even after an Arm Guarantee
Trigger Event. Upon default, the lenders can satisfy their claim either through the collateral of 75.01% interest in the Company or through the Company servicing the debt and meeting payment obligations pursuant to the Guarantee. SoftBank Group as
the owner of Kronos may avoid default by restructuring the Facility Agreement, or otherwise monetizing the collateral for the necessary liquidity to meet payment obligations under the Facility Agreement. The Company believes that the likelihood of
assuming the debt obligations under the Guarantee is remote due to Kronos’ significant collateralization of the obligations under the Facility Agreement and that SoftBank Group will avoid a default by Kronos for which the obligations would
become enforceable against the Company. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the Company’s potential obligation is an issued Guarantee to the lenders for obligations of Kronos, an
entity under common control, the Company is not required to recognize the Guarantee. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Arduino Guarantee </i></b></p>

<p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
U.S. (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial information. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read

adjustments, which are necessary for the fair statement of the condensed consolidated balance sheets, income statements and cash flows for these interim periods. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the
full fiscal year. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Principles of Consolidation </i></b></p>

statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, share-based
compensation, impairment considerations for long-lived assets, fair value estimates and impairment for investments. The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis and revises estimates as circumstances change. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience, anticipated results, trends, and other various assumptions that it believes are reasonable. Inputs used in judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of

Certain forecasted transactions, specifically British Pound&nbsp;Sterling (“GBP”) denominated cash flows in the form of payroll and selling, general and administrative expenses are exposed to foreign currency risk. The Company monitors
foreign currency exposures on a monthly basis to maximize the economic effectiveness of foreign currency hedge positions. </p>

obligations. Revenue recognition occurs upon delivery or beginning of license term, whichever is later. Accordingly, the analysis between time bands below has been estimated, but the final timing may differ from these estimates. In the absence of
sufficient information, where the timing of satisfaction of the remaining performance obligations is dependent on a customer’s action, the transaction price allocated to such performance obligation is included in the outer-year time band unless
contract or option expiration aligns with an earlier period or category. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of June&nbsp;30, 2023, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining

</i></b></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company elected the fair value option in accordance with the guidance in ASC 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”) for its
investments in Acetone Limited, and Ampere. The Company initially computed the fair value for its investments consistent with the methodology and assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value with the assistance of
a third-party valuation specialist or based on inputs from the investee. The fair value computation is updated on a quarterly basis. The investments are classified within Level&nbsp;3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the
fair value of the investments using the (i)&nbsp;the market-calibration approach based on the guideline public company method and/or (ii)&nbsp;subject to availability of sufficient information, the income approach based on the discounted cash flow
method and iii) the probability-weighted, expected return (“PWER”) approach. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The market-calibration approach considers valuation multiples that
are calibrated to the valuation as of the prior valuation date (i.e., quarterly) based on: (a)&nbsp;changes in the broader market or industry; (b)&nbsp;changes in the guideline public companies; and (c)&nbsp;changes in the company’s operating
and financial performance. The fair value computation under this approach includes a key assumption for the range of valuation multiples (i.e., enterprise value or revenue), which requires significant professional judgment by the valuation
specialist and is based on observable inputs (e.g., market data) and unobservable inputs (e.g., market participant assumptions). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the fiscal quarters
ended June&nbsp;30, 2023, the PWER approach was used to measure the fair value of Ampere. The PWER approach is based on discrete future exit scenarios to determine the value of various equity securities.

<font style="white-space:nowrap">non-current</font> assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June&nbsp;30, 2023 and March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss are the amounts invested in, and advanced to,

value of the Ampere convertible loan is based upon significant unobservable inputs, including the use of a probability weighted discounted cash flows model, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. Therefore, the Company has categorized
this asset as a Level&nbsp;3 financial asset. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of the more significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the convertible loan
include applicable discount rates, the likelihood and projected timing of repayment or conversion, and projected cash flows in support of the estimated enterprise value of Ampere. Changes in these assumptions, while holding other inputs constant,
could result in a significant change in the fair value of the convertible loan. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the amortized cost of the convertible loan exceeds its estimated fair
value, the security is deemed to be impaired, and must be evaluated for the recognition of credit losses. Impairment resulting from credit losses is recognized within earnings, while impairment resulting from other factors is recognized in other
comprehensive income (loss). As of June&nbsp;30, 2023 and March&nbsp;31, 2023, the Company has not recognized any credit losses related to this convertible loan. </p>

vesting for approximately 435 employees affected by restructuring activities initiated in the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2022. The affected participants of the plan were provided the option to i) settle all unvested RSUs for a cash payment equivalent
to the product of (a)&nbsp;a fixed amount as determined by the remuneration committee (b) 50% of the number of RSUs held by the participant, or ii) retain the RSUs until they become vested pursuant to the original vesting terms. The Company
accounted for this acceleration as a modification of vesting in connection with a settlement which resulted in the recognition of incremental share-based compensation cost. For the fiscal quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2022, the Company recognized
incremental share-based compensation cost of $11.8&nbsp;million related to the cash receipt option and $2.2&nbsp;million related to the RSUs retention option, respectively. </p>

Company (“All Employee Awards”). The RSUs vest in tranches, require continuous service through the vesting date and are subject to graded vesting over time. The 2022 RSU Plan allows for either cash or share settlement of the RSUs by
tranche at the discretion of the Company’s remuneration committee. At the time of issuance, the Company intended to settle the RSUs in shares at the vesting date and such RSUs were accounted for as equity-classified awards. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2022, the Company determined that it would settle the first tranche of the RSUs outstanding that vested in March and May 2023 by paying cash
instead of issuing equity. Other than the change in intent regarding form of settlement, no other terms or conditions regarding the RSUs were changed. The Company accounted for this change as a modification in accordance with ASC 718,
<i>Compensation—Stock Compensation</i>, and reclassified the affected portion of the award from equity to liability and will remeasure the award at fair value at each reporting period through the date of settlement with consideration that total
compensation cost cannot be less than the grant-date fair-value-based measure of the original award. </p>

United Kingdom subsidiary of SoftBank Group, Kronos I (UK) Limited (“Kronos”), was created for the purpose of SoftBank Group arranging a facility agreement (the “Facility Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan SE as Facility Agent to be
secured by its equity interest in the Company. SoftBank Group pledged its ownership interest in the Company by transferring such interest to an entity that sits between Kronos and the Company, and SoftBank Group has no further obligation under the
Facility Agreement. The Company is in compliance with all applicable operating and financial covenants pursuant to the Facility Agreement for the periods presented. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Facility Agreement, the lenders initially were committed to make up to $8.0&nbsp;billion of funds available to Kronos under a “Bridge
Facility” and “Term Facility” (together with the Bridge Facility, the “Facility”). In March 2022, the Term Facility was funded for $7.1&nbsp;billion and the Bridge Facility was funded for $0.9&nbsp;billion. </p>
<p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2022, an amendment was executed which expanded the total commitment of the Term Facility to $8.5&nbsp;billion via an additional term facility of
$1.4&nbsp;billion, $0.9&nbsp;billion of which was used to repay the Bridge Facility in full with the remaining $0.5&nbsp;billion representing incremental debt. The Term Facility matures on the earlier of two years after Kronos draws upon the
facility or three months after the effective date of a public listing of the Company’s ordinary shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beyond the pledge of the interest in the
Company as collateral for the Facility, in March 2022, the Company entered into the Arm Undertaking (the “Undertaking”) to confirm and agree to comply with certain terms of the Facility Agreement (including operational restrictions) and a
springing guarantee and indemnity agreement (the “Guarantee”) with J.P. Morgan SE. The Guarantee commences upon an “Arm Guarantee Trigger Event,” which includes a public listing of the Company’s ordinary shares not occurring
within 18 months of the closing date of the Facility or any public announcement or notice to lenders that a listing will not be undertaken and failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with the obligations under the Undertaking. Until an
Arm Guarantee Trigger Event occurs, the Company is not obligated to perform or make payment on the obligations of Kronos. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once an Arm Guarantee Trigger
Event has occurred, the Company guarantees all overdue payments under the Facility Agreement. The total commitment is $8.5&nbsp;billion and would only become a potential obligation to the Company if Kronos were to default on any such obligation, as
Kronos remains the primary obligor under the Facility Agreement even after an Arm Guarantee Trigger Event. Upon default, the lenders can satisfy their claim either through the collateral of Kronos’ interest in the Company or through the Company
servicing the debt and meeting payment obligations pursuant to the Guarantee. SoftBank Group as the owner of Kronos may avoid default by restructuring the Facility Agreement, or otherwise monetizing the collateral for the necessary liquidity to meet
payment obligations under the Facility Agreement. The Company believes that the likelihood of assuming the debt obligations under the Guarantee is remote due to Kronos’ significant collateralization of the obligations under the Facility
Agreement and that SoftBank Group will avoid a default by Kronos for which the obligations would become enforceable against the Company. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the
Company’s potential obligation is an issued Guarantee to the lenders for obligations of Kronos, an entity under common control, the Company is not required to recognize the Guarantee. </p>
