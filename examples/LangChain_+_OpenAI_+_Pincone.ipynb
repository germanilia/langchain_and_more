File properties are also needed to correctly \\nreference the product information.  \\nThe properties and bookmarks can be set in two ways: \\n1. directly in the PDF document each time after conversion (method 1 , pages 1- 4) \\n2. in the Word source document prior to conversion to PDF ( method 2 , pages 4- 8).  \\nMethod 1 has the advantage that the bookmark will direct you to the top of the page instead of to the \\nspecific line in the text. It is also possible to select more than one full product  name  in one bookmark.  \\nMethod 2 has the advantage that properties and bookmarks need only be defined once in the Word file \\nfor each language version; they will be maintained for each subsequent revision of the product \\ninformation and are automatically carried over in  the converted PDF files.  \\nThe two methods are explained below.  \\nMethod 1: setting properties and bookmarks in the generated PDF files \\n1. Conversion of the Word source file into PDF  \\nBefore converting to PDF, accept all highlights (track changes) and comments fr om the Word source \\nfile. Use any appropriate method and software to convert the Word source file into a PDF file.  \\n2. Setting bookmarks and properties in the converted PDF file  \\n1. Open  the generated PDF file in Adobe Acrobat Writer.  \\n2. Scroll through the document to  check the quality of the conversion. In particular check \\nthat the PDF conversion from Word has not created extra blank pages to the original \\ndocument. If blank pages are present in the PDF document, amend the page break \\ncorresponding to the blank pages in  the Word source file and convert to PDF again.  \\n3.
